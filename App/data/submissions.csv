Get in while you still can and your broker allows trading on the platform. Most brokerages have stopped allowing some OTC stocks. Currently, SoFi and TD Ameritrade are the only brokers that I am aware allow trading of Sears.

The movement seen last week was nothing compared to what's to come.

Yes, its the bankrupt company from yesteryear. However, the company is far from worthless and far from the undervalued price it sits at which, at the time of writing this post is at .41¢

The company is currently in what's known as 368(a)(1)(A) reorganization.

This means that the company is in statutory merger and consolidation.

Sears aka Transform Holdco is mainly comprised of real asset assets but also has some services which only add value. Transform Holdco (New Sears) consists of 70+ stores, Sears Home Services, The Your Way Citi Credit Card Revenue and rewards program, 1100 pieces of unencumbered real estate and long term leases, Kenmore, Craftsman, 1.2 billion in cash from the sale of Innovel Solutions to Costco and Advance Auto parts.

Per the asset purchase agreement between Transform Holdco, LLC and Sears Holdings must be liquidated by the end of the third taxable year of the sale of substantially all of the Sears Holidings assets in February 2019 which is Feb / March 2022.

Former Sear Holdings' Shareholders will be paid in Transform Holdco stock and cash, Sears Holdings will merge with Transform Holdco and Sears Holdings will be continuing entity.

There's two ways to play this. This stock is already getting attention due to recent legal proceedings and rumors of Amazon / GME being involved in reorganization. I can't speculate on any of that and sounds like something WSB concocted. However:

1. First way to play this is buy this week and sell on or before September 28th. Sears will be removed from trading platforms Sep 28th. More news will come forward this month regarding the reorganization. Knowledge of the inability to purchase will cause scarcity and there will be significant price fluctuation. Good entry and exit points are crucial if you plan to jump ship prior to September 28th.
2. You hold until after the 28th. Refer to image below regarding restructuring. Others estimate that the payout would be worth roughly $20/share. Which would be around 50X of current stock price.

Isn’t the definition of “pump and dump” when a small group push one or two stocks onto a larger group of people and tell them they will be rich? Did we learn nothing from Wolf or Wall Street?

I understand that it’s time to make the shorts pay and I’m all for that. I’ve been a SIRI holder for a long time, so I know how shorts kill a stock. It’s time they pay. No doubt. But my question is…. Who’s shorting GME or AMC now? Who would possibly want to do that after what happened in January? 

AMC recently just moved up from the $30’s to the $45 range. 

GME went from the $150’s to $220’s…. 

So that’s your squeeze right? The profits for everyone especially the “apes” are through the roof… but how do they sell now without hurting one another? Maybe just maybe it’s when they scream “buy the dips” or “hold the line.” Why wouldn’t they push this Wolf of Wall Street mindset of “we are an army.” Sure you are an army, but 90% of you are soldiers pumping so that they can dump it. You are the one’s making 50-60k a year running up onto the beach taking shrapnel, while the generals are watching safely from there homes selling the stock and making a profit. 

It’s sort of sad to watch the older GenZ’s and younger Millennials fall for this trick. Social media is a powerful thing. I don’t hate what WSB did. When it squeezed those shorts back in January, it was epic. But isn’t it time to move on and squeeze elsewhere? Be that hero again and make some of those shorts wish they never shorted a stock in the first place? 

Or has WSB lost what it came here to do? It’s hard to believe that “apes” care about some college students bank account when they can pump and dump AMC and GME and then part all Labor Day weekend on profits. 

Anyway, I’m not trying to give financial advice by any means. Just stating my opinion. I’m sure i’ll be called a shill 900 times in the comments… but this was just to open up some of your eyes a little.

Maybe just maybe it’s when they scream “buy the dips” or “hold the line.” Why wouldn’t they push this Wolf of Wall Street mindset of “we are an army.” Sure you are an army, but 90% of you are soldiers pumping so that they can dump it. You are the one’s making 50-60k a year running up onto the beach taking shrapnel, while the generals are watching safely from there homes selling the stock and making a profit. 

It’s sort of sad to watch the older GenZ’s and younger Millennials fall for this trick. Social media is a powerful thing. I don’t hate what WSB did. When it squeezed those shorts back in January, it was epic. But isn’t it time to move on and squeeze elsewhere? Be that hero again and make some of those shorts wish they never shorted a stock in the first place? 

Or has WSB lost what it came here to do? It’s hard to believe that “apes” care about some college students bank account when they can pump and dump AMC and GME and then part all Labor Day weekend on profits. 

Anyway, I’m not trying to give financial advice by any means. Just stating my opinion. I’m sure i’ll be called a shill 900 times in the comments… but this was just to open up some of your eyes a little.

**Disclaimer:** I am by no means an expert on this topic, I like to snort green crayons but recently have been getting into some reds, and therefore barely know wtf I'm talking about. I'm not arrogant enough to claim I know everything to do with this and won't pretend to. Do your own DD, come up with your own conclusions, and remember the economy always goes up until it doesn't. 

Outside of a few select stock subreddits that I shall not name here, not many people seem to be talking about Reverse Repos and their subsequent effect on the market. Let's fix that, shall we? 

**What are Overnight Reverse Repos (ONRRP)?** 

I'm not gonna bore the shit out of y'all with a bunch of technical jargon so I shall simplify it (and note: this is a *simplification* and therefore some nuance and detail is not included, so go fuck yourself if you feel the need to be an ass about something I didn't include.) 

Reverse Repo's are basically an agreement between the Federal Reserve (which is *not* the same thing as the Federal government) and large financial institutions (banks, hedge funds, Market Makers, your wife's boyfriend, etc.) that basically boils down to the Fed giving these institutions a ""specified security"" (usually U.S. Treasury Bonds) in exchange for cash. Now, since the government is stingy with their T-Bonds and Financial institutions might need their money back at a moment's notice, these transactions are essentially reversed at the end of the day. 

The Reverse Repo Program (Or RRP for short) is ""officially"" used to tighten the money supply. (Note how I said officially, I'll come back to that later.)

Now, there is another program that is sometimes mentioned, called the Repo Program, which is basically the opposite of the Reverse Repo. It is used to ""inflate"" the money supply in the economy. I will not go into much more detail on this program since I have used my remaining few brain cells to understand Reverse Repos and not much else.

**Cool, but, like, why?** 

So to understand why this program is essential to ""control the money supply"" (aka Decrease Inflation), you have to understand one thing about these big financial institutions. 

**Cash = Bad**

Seems counterintuitive, right?  Well, sort of. Basically, cash in itself is bad for these businesses because of one simple reason; Inflation. Cash is considered a liability (a risk) on their balance sheets when it's just sitting there not doing anything. Does the phrase ""Use money to make money"" ring a bell? Regardless, Institutions need to have most of their money in investments in order to not lose money and any opportunities to make money. 

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about what exactly these bad boys have been doing for the last year and a half.

**What the Fed doin'?**

Here I'm going to lay out the facts of the matter and leave the speculation as to the why's further down in the next section. So, I hope y'all like pictures. 

Starting in March of this year, The RRP had begun to be used after nearly a year of nothing. This began after margin requirements for banks were reinstated in March after the Fed had significantly lowered them to help the economy after the COVID crash. 

*Processing img qandbr09xqk71...*

It has only increased since. 

Not only that, the *way* it has increased is rather unusual compared to the past. Up until around late 2018, the RRP market was used rather frequently but usually only during Quater ends. 

*Processing img lusi5amazil71...*

So this sharp increase with seemingly no correlation with Quarter ends has led to a lot of people smelling the bullshit so to speak. 

**1 Trilly Baby**

Since August 11th, the RRP has been above 1 Trillion and has, as of August 31st, hit a high of 1.189 Trillion. The previous high before this year was around $474 billion in 2015, right at the end of Quater 4. 

**Why is this happening?** 

The simple answer is that we don't know. Don't pull out the pitchforks quite yet, there are a few theories as to why just no concrete reason (as of yet) since none of the big boys want to reveal their hands. 

**Stock Market Crash**

The Stock Market has been reaching ATH's for the last few weeks and with the eviction moratorium ending, and possibly up to 11 million families at risk of losing their homes, there's a chance a crash is coming which may make 2008 look like peanuts in comparison. (MBS's anyone?)  *""The last time this many families were behind on their mortgages was during the Great Recession."" - CFPB* 

In regards to this coming crash, it's possible that big investors are unwilling to risk putting more money into the market when they can rely on the government with their T-bonds. (Which also helps their margin requirements, so win-win for them.) I admit, this is pretty speculative and needs further research than what I'm willing to do right now.

**Collateral Crisis** 

There is some evidence that there is an actual shortage of Treasury bills within the market (dropping yields from their highs earlier this year) which could explain the Big Boys reliance on the FED and RRP. Oh, and the money printer himself, JPOW, said this, *“You could say there is a shortage of safe short assets… there’s a shortage of T-bills”*. So, yeah that's mildly concerning. 

**Short Positions**

Another reason as to the apparent need for bonds could be risky bets made by financial institutions (""meme"" stocks anyone?) and the inevitability of short positions bankrupting them. I seriously doubt any of the big boys have closed most of their short positions yet so this is my personal theory. 

There is also a chance that it's a combination of all three, none, or something else entirely that has yet to rear its ugly head. 

**TL;DR PT 2**

The point is; Reverse Repo's are a signal that the market is in risky shape due to unavoidable monetary policy decisions by the Fed (brought on by COVID) and Financial Institutions taking incredibly risky bets with other peoples' money. Time will tell what exactly caused this spike in Reverse Repo's but I'd hedge your bets whichever way you can.

Out of the last 20 ish stocks wsb mentioned only 3 have been great , ( im excluding tesla and apple as they arent really meme stocks anymore )

here look at this sndl,bb,wish,gme,amc,wen,crsr,uwmc,rkt,rklb,sofi,sava,sklz,pltr,gld,root,em,mvis just to name a few out of all of the memes stocks discussed. out of those stocks really 3 of them are still going strong which are amc,gme,pltr the rest of these stocks just fell out, when i say fell out i mean they are back to around the price they orginally were granted maybe a buck or 2 higher due to so many bag holders but you see the point im bringing out.

**PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO YOUR OWN DD AND COMPARE IT TO WHATEVER ANYONE SAYS ON THIS SUB.**

Also just needed to say this , investing and trading are different ... aver

Investing= I Dont give a fuck if pltr drops to 20 bucks or if it is range for a week or 2 , im buying in this company and expecting it to be worth 5x 5-10 years from now . These small 20-5 cent fighhts each day dont mean shit to me.

Another example , tesla oh shit its been inthe 600-700 range for a while , idc cause im holding for a few years.

Investing is buying into a company that you believe due to dd is going to be worth more over the long run and you  **dont give 2 fucks about the daily /weekly price battles.** 

trading on the other hand is = whats the catalyst? Trading is in my opinion figuring out what the catalyst us and using that catalyst ti your advantage.

Here let me put it like this spce had a catalyst which was that launch thing(space mission) . Tradrers bought a position before the launch and after the launch they sold off. Really it was right b4 the launch actually happened. But you see what i mean. 

Shit nvidia had a stock split announcement , thats a catalyst for traders to buy lots of shares of it and sell off on the split date.  Again trading on a catalyst .

Shit the catalyst could be a TA for instance netflix was trading in a 500-600 channel. When netflix dropped close to its support traders bought into it as it bounced off the 500 support and ran back to the 600 resistance ... yall see?

**Trading is finding a catalyst for a stock and then figuring out how it will effect the stock price in the short term and using it to your advantage.**

Well, I am pretty new over here. I can see that together we can make big things. The only thing is that we have no plan. One yells ""MOASS"" here and we all jump on the meme stock like if it was bananas... And then... We wait... We fight for months with HFs with unlimited funds ans access to moans and stuff... 

We are diluted over GME AMC CLOV WKHS and many others.
Isnt it time to settle a plan? A road map

We have great analysts with fantastic comments. Why not gathering all our strength, all together to squeeze harder and faster the HF that stole us for so long.
They are strong they manipulate the market for their sake. They don't even a fuck of laws with the darkppol.
We are just starting to play the same rules. We just need to be more focused.

I know no one is ready to leave his beliefs upon my single call, but if we could just focus on a few stocks. 1,2, 3 not more.
Everyone doing his own DD of course but those how decide to follow would know they will be stronger.
The only thing is to avoid HF to enter this pool of "" master apes"" for obvious reasons.

GME case was fantastic, now we are diluted... 
No financial advice, just a path that apes may follow or not.

Is this that stupid?
Is such a road map a matter of legal questioning?

so ending normal funnies and jokes- here’s something that you all will need to understand and hopefully help you on your tax understanding. 

Now it won’t be much fun to read it but knowing it may be helpful to you at some point.

1) what is wash sale rule? 

&gt;A wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days before or after, buys another one that is substantially similar.

Now the actual way to understanding this is kind of complex and even out of the scope of this post. You can be held at a tax higher than your gain (some retard got a 800k tax bill in a 40k gain because of wash sale rule since he was trading same stocks 10+ times a day). 

But do know that this rule, is made to stop shady things. It usually won’t effect you because brokerages are smart enough to realize it and do mathematical calculation to your second buy to fix the wash sale rule instantly. But there can be mistakes. 

NOTE: you should only be paying taxes on your actual gain and deducting from your all losses (total after net year). If anything is wrong, see tax accountant instantly. 

2)  tax-loss harvesting

This is like algebra math where you try to add and subtract to get the best number. Say you have 2 positions, one in AMD and one in GME. You realized a gain (so you closed your position) on AMD but still have your GME options chugging along. Your GME options don’t expire until next year but they are in loss. It’s December- so you say “wait, rather than pay full tax on my gains from AMD, why don’t I close my GME positions for a loss and now I can subtract that loss from my AMD gain and pay less tax”. 

3) deduction of capital loss

You say you have -20k realized loss in 2020. You can deduct 3000$ from your earned income every year until that 20k is used up. This means you lost 20k in stocks but made 60k in your job- you can automatically deduct 3000 from your income so now you effectively have a 57,000$ income for tax. 

Now some people are confused but this is only for EARNED INCOME. The 3000 deduction limit is so it’s not abused. But say you have 2021 capital gain from GME of 15k. 

Here if you still had -20k loss of 2020, you can deduct the full 15k gain from 2021 so that -20k loss now is at 5k loss and use the remaining 3000 from 5k to deduct the earned income (from job) of 2021. For a total net loss of -2k still left for next year. 

4) positions that you hold for less than 1 year will be taxed at higher % than positions held more than year. 

There are more Things like Tax-optimized Portfolio and many other tax implication that are too far out of reach for a single post but be aware of all these things.

And I want to say thank you. The longer this game(don't stop) goes on, the more shares I'm able to obtain and the harder my nips get knowing I too did my part to fuck back this corrupted system. Cheers to all holding for a better future  


Mods may remove, they usually remove my ramblings, but it's good therapy to get it out all the same :)

Unlike other metals, it is virtually impossible manipulate, thorough paper, imitation, or recycling—once it leaves storage it is SPENT. Gone, good buy---they need more, or the power goes out, not an option.

This will be the easiest and probably only 10 bagger many will ever experience. You will have plenty of chances to take profits, and you will exit based on the price of U. 

There are smarter contributors who have provided the economics for those that can read.

$ìŔņť - IronNet Cyber Security - an actual gamma squeeze candidate?

MODS, please unban the ticker name for this company as it now meets the requirements to be posted here. I am using the full name of the company on this post because I can't post the ticker.

This information couldn't be shared on Wall Street Bets before because the market cap was below the $1.5 Billion limit. As of after-hours closing on Sept 3rd, the market cap is now about $2.45 billion (84.42 million shares outstanding multiplied by $29.23 closing price).


To start with, I am super skeptical of anything that mentions the word ""squeeze."" Post-GME, it became a way to lure in suckers to be holding the dump after your pump. However, either this is going to be an honest to God gamma squeeze, or I've missed something big time.

Here's the background. ĎFÑŚ, a pretty good SPAC sponsor actually, acquired IronNet Cyber Security. However, 90% of the shares were redeemed last week. This brought the total float down to 1.2M shares. In addition, 1.5M shares from management were unlocked, giving us a total 2.7M shares available to trade.

Usually, options trading requires a much higher float than this. The CBOE requires a 7M share float (technically, 7M shares owned by holders without reporting requirements), and 2.4M shares traded in the last 12 months before allowing options trading. $ìŔņť is far below that, but before redemptions ĎFÑŚ wasn't. This has created a bit of a hole in the CBOE liquidity rulebook.

What does that mean for us? Well, there are a huge number of options being traded and a huge OI growing by the day. There are something like 40k total call options outstanding and more than 30k in September expiries alone, and there's also been almost no retail interest either on Reddit or Twitter. I see a few reasons for that - market cap rules, the ticker change creates a delay in data for stock screeners to start finding it, and there have been plenty of other exciting meme trades over the last week. To me that means we're looking at smart money accumulating options with the intention of driving a gamma squeeze. Once retail catches on, they'll maintain the momentum and be left holding the bag.

Let's do a deeper dive on what these calls represent relative to the float. I've looked at September calls only and pulled the latest OI from CBOE. That data is below.

https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9

Remember that puts have the exact opposite hedging behavior as calls, so I've netted them out and included their impact on gamma as well. Currently, 31% of the float is tied up hedging these long calls. On top of that, a $1 increase in the underlying price will drive net buying of ~11% of the float in order to maintain delta-neutrality. In addition, gamma will increase and the net hedging will accelerate as the $17.5 and $20 strikes get closer to in the money. This gives us a price around $17 where there aren't enough shares to hedge the outstanding pool of call options and we get a gamma squeeze.

Conversely, this option pricing effect can be just as dramatic on the downside as the upside. If the price falls below $10, expect most of the 400k shares represented by the $12.5 strikes to add to selling pressure.

There is one major assumption we're making here - that all these trades are unilateral with the market maker and the market maker is taking the short side of that trade. That's almost certainly not true, but I believe it's fair to assume the majority are.

In summary, I *think* we are watching one or more hedge funds set up for a dramatic spike in share price caused by market dynamics. Similarly, I think now is the time to invest alongside them to get a quick 4-5x return.

I'll end with a request. If you have information that disproves this thesis please share it. I have been looking for contradictory evidence, but have found very little.

Edit:
From their latest 8-K filed today. Post merger, there were 84,423,567 shares outstanding. 66,160,197 are subject to a lockup. 12,500,000 were PIPE shares that are not yet registered and not yet tradable, and 3.2M shares that are locked up except for charitable donations. The exact numbers are below.

https://preview.redd.it/kak6phy0vzk71.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=738ab4508c91af5280dc8255017c54f5cd8e8f76

The next shares that are expected to be tradable are the 1,078,125 incentive shares that are awarded to legacy shareholders if the stock price exceeds $13 for 10 consecutive days. The earliest that could be is September 9th. If this goes off, it will be before the 9th.

Edit #2:

$IRNT IronNet, Inc. - an actual gamma squeeze candidate?
MODS, please unban the ticker name for this company as it now meets the requirements to be posted here. I am using the full name of the company on this post because I can't post the ticker.

This information couldn't be shared on Wall Street Bets before because the market cap was below the $1.5 Billion limit. As of after-hours closing on Sept 3rd, the market cap is now about $2.45 billion (84.42 million shares outstanding multiplied by $29.23 closing price).

To start with, I am super skeptical of anything that mentions the word ""squeeze."" Post-GME, it became a way to lure in suckers to be holding the dump after your pump. However, either this is going to be an honest to God gamma squeeze, or I've missed something big time.

Here's the background...a pretty good SPAC sponsor actually, acquired IronNet Cyber Security. However, 90% of the shares were redeemed last week. This brought the total float down to 1.2M shares. In addition, 1.5M shares from management were unlocked, giving us a total 2.7M shares available to trade.

Usually, options trading requires a much higher float than this. The CBOE requires a 7M share float (technically, 7M shares owned by holders without reporting requirements), and 2.4M shares traded in the last 12 months before allowing options trading. $ IronNet Cyber Security is far below that, but before redemptions, the SPAC sponsor wasn't. This has created a bit of a hole in the CBOE liquidity rulebook.

What does that mean for us? Well, there are a huge number of options being traded and a huge OI growing by the day. There are something like 40k total call options outstanding and more than 30k in September expiries alone, and there's also been almost no retail interest either on Reddit or Twitter. I see a few reasons for that - market cap rules, the ticker change creates a delay in data for stock screeners to start finding it, and there have been plenty of other exciting meme trades over the last week. To me that means we're looking at smart money accumulating options with the intention of driving a gamma squeeze. Once retail catches on, they'll maintain the momentum and be left holding the bag.

Let's do a deeper dive on what these calls represent relative to the float. I've looked at September calls only and pulled the latest OI from CBOE. That data is below.
https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9

Remember that puts have the exact opposite hedging behavior as calls, so I've netted them out and included their impact on gamma as well. Currently, 31% of the float is tied up hedging these long calls. On top of that, a $1 increase in the underlying price will drive net buying of ~11% of the float in order to maintain delta-neutrality. In addition, gamma will increase and the net hedging will accelerate as the $17.5 and $20 strikes get closer to in the money. This gives us a price around $17 where there aren't enough shares to hedge the outstanding pool of call options and we get a gamma squeeze.

Conversely, this option pricing effect can be just as dramatic on the downside as the upside. If the price falls below $10, expect most of the 400k shares represented by the $12.5 strikes to add to selling pressure.

There is one major assumption we're making here - that all these trades are unilateral with the market maker and the market maker is taking the short side of that trade. That's almost certainly not true, but I believe it's fair to assume the majority are.

In summary, I *think* we are watching one or more hedge funds set up for a dramatic spike in share price caused by market dynamics. Similarly, I think now is the time to invest alongside them to get a quick 4-5x return.
I'll end with a request. If you have information that disproves this thesis please share it. I have been looking for contradictory evidence, but have found very little.

After looking down at my 6 inch cock and looking at her she proceeded to tell me that she'd make a deal with me.

$I R N T - IronNet Cyber Security - an actual gamma squeeze candidate?

This information couldn't be shared on Wall Street Bets before because the market cap was below the $1.5 Billion limit. As of after-hours closing on Sept 3rd, the market cap is now about $2.45 billion (84.42 million shares outstanding multiplied by $29.23 closing price).

To start with, I am super skeptical of anything that mentions the word ""squeeze."" Post-GME, it became a way to lure in suckers to be holding the dump after your pump. However, either this is going to be an honest to God gamma squeeze, or I've missed something big time.

Here's the background. D F N S, a pretty good SPAC sponsor actually, acquired IronNet Cyber Security. However, 90% of the shares were redeemed last week. This brought the total float down to 1.2M shares. In addition, 1.5M shares from management were unlocked, giving us a total 2.7M shares available to trade.

Usually, options trading requires a much higher float than this. The CBOE requires a 7M share float (technically, 7M shares owned by holders without reporting requirements), and 2.4M shares traded in the last 12 months before allowing options trading. $I R N T is far below that, but before redemptions DFNS wasn't. This has created a bit of a hole in the CBOE liquidity rulebook.

What does that mean for us? Well, there are a huge number of options being traded and a huge OI growing by the day. There are something like 40k total call options outstanding and more than 30k in September expiries alone, and there's also been almost no retail interest either on Reddit or Twitter. I see a few reasons for that - market cap rules, the ticker change creates a delay in data for stock screeners to start finding it, and there have been plenty of other exciting meme trades over the last week. To me that means we're looking at smart money accumulating options with the intention of driving a gamma squeeze. Once retail catches on, they'll maintain the momentum and be left holding the bag.

Let's do a deeper dive on what these calls represent relative to the float. I've looked at September calls only and pulled the latest OI from CBOE. That data is below.

[https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9](https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9)

Remember that puts have the exact opposite hedging behavior as calls, so I've netted them out and included their impact on gamma as well. Currently, 31% of the float is tied up hedging these long calls. On top of that, a $1 increase in the underlying price will drive net buying of \~11% of the float in order to maintain delta-neutrality. In addition, gamma will increase and the net hedging will accelerate as the $17.5 and $20 strikes get closer to in the money. This gives us a price around $17 where there aren't enough shares to hedge the outstanding pool of call options and we get a gamma squeeze.

Conversely, this option pricing effect can be just as dramatic on the downside as the upside. If the price falls below $10, expect most of the 400k shares represented by the $12.5 strikes to add to selling pressure.

There is one major assumption we're making here - that all these trades are unilateral with the market maker and the market maker is taking the short side of that trade. That's almost certainly not true, but I believe it's fair to assume the majority are.

In summary, I \*think\* we are watching one or more hedge funds set up for a dramatic spike in share price caused by market dynamics. Similarly, I think now is the time to invest alongside them to get a quick 4-5x return.

I'll end with a request. If you have information that disproves this thesis please share it. I have been looking for contradictory evidence, but have found very little.

**Edit:**

From their latest 8-K filed today. Post merger, there were 84,423,567 shares outstanding. 66,160,197 are subject to a lockup. 12,500,000 were PIPE shares that are not yet registered and not yet tradable, and 3.2M shares that are locked up except for charitable donations. The exact numbers are below.

We are living in a new era of retail investing where people throw money at a company based on group consensus, rather than merely stable profit. Unfortunately this leads to people investing in companies that are being short-sold for good reason, gambling companies, mortgage companies and companies that don't actually provide new value to the economy; what is nice to see is that this dynamic has led people to invest in companies that they actually care about and which provide new value, the $TSLA and $GME booms are indicative of this.

Richard Branson wrote the book ""Screw Business As Usual"" which ushered in an age of moral investing and has become the backbone of Elon Musk's business philosophy, the numbers speak for themselves, Tesla now has a market cap 2.9 times higher than the second most valuable car company, Toyota.

Virgin Galactic ($SPCE) was founded by Richard Branson; the company's mission: ""**to be the spaceline for Earth**  – means we focus on using space for good while delivering an  unparalleled customer experience.

While the company does not have a rigorously defined, ambitious, overarching goal as SpaceX does, (to facilitate a colony of one million people on Mars) it aims to create a space tourism industry and generate interest in space, something that has been sorely missing the last fifty years, the Apollo programs are responsible for GPS and the internet, Virgin Galactic is already responsible for several innovations in space flight, I would not be entirely surprised by a collaboration between SpaceX and Virgin Galactic as both CEOs are very supportive of each other, with Elon Musk recently taking time out of his day to wish Branson luck, in person, to win the billionaire space race against Jeff Bezos.

Needless to mention that at a high position at GME( I don't recall her name) said squeeze won't happen. Even if the stock is shorted there's not enough volume to move it. So many DD that I've read are either misleading or wrong, technical analysis wrong. Even when dfv bought like 200k shares gme has barely moved.

So heres a little summary for you fkers!

Jobs report came in really really bad , like i mean worse then some of yalls options strategies . It came in at fking 235,000 vs the expected 700k . Do the math , thats a miss of a little over 66% , so ig its not as bad as some of yalls options plays but oh well its still bad.

This is good for the economy because we havent hit further economic growth that jerome powell needs to shut off the money printer , now the 10yr did sky rocket a bit because inflation fears( kinda y we had a bloody morning start followed by a nice rally) but over all it died off because well... we are still getting that fix of 120 billion dollars .So thats why the market went greenin the end and fked the rainbow fags... i mean bear but anyway.

Really we dont give af about anything else , if anything expect maybe a pull back next next week due to cpi data but since we fked that jobs report number its safe to say tapering wont happen too soon so the rally continues , furthermore the only other pull back i can see is maybe during the fomc meeting but thats it.

Furthermore hella stocks are looking bullish asf / doing amazing

heres a few ive been looking at and ill explain whats up

Netflix, Google, amazon, baba, tesla, mrna,

Soo if yall have been paying attention netflix follows a trend of being in this 500-600 channel this lattest attempt to break out was actually pretty good , shit it didnt even go back to test that 575 level instead it just popped down to 582ish before running back and ending green on the day. Now i will say that usually after a rejection of the 600 level it starts a quick down trend but with how strong it was with low volume compared to prior days , it could break out next week but who knows. If it breaks out then just know its going to be a monster .

Google, nothing needs to be said its fucking google, i bet your left ball and right ass cheek your using google rn or used it today atleast once. But no in seriousness it had a nice pull back today and bounced right back which is good asf. With earnings season coming up soon and really no bad catalysts coming up , i think 3k will be here soon.

Amazon!!!! This baby was down bad after earnings but it finally bounced off of i believe 3175ish and is now climbing back to 3600 . super strong uptrend , shit it climbed 200ish bucks this week and had a pull back and recovered ending the day green as well. Cant wait to see whats left.

baba, well yall know the deal undervalued chinese stock thats not shit .... plus the chinese government is starting to like it again ... plus all the wsb dd.... bullish asffffffff

Gme and amc bullish earnings next week soo run up again?????

Tesla, it held the 725 support!!!!! and eneded green on the day.... baby its starting to rocket plus it broke that down trend and broke out that 600-700 channel that its been in for like the last 6 months ish . Bullish asfffff

Mrna , well this one is special... no not like retards .... i mean like it broke out of the 400 resistance ... so ig ath coming soon?? Either way bullish asfff

Covid is still rising and the rest of the world is scared to shit but wtf do we care about that , mrna is booming and a lot of stocks are actually looking bullish asffff.

None of this is financial advice and i dont even have a degree to be quakified .

Or our wife's boyfriends asking my we are only eating ramen noodles every day. I decided to share my personal method for helping fellow smooth brains get a basic understand of this whole mess.

This is of course done in the form of a children's bedtime story. Because fuck you, that's why.


*******************************************



Once oppon a time. In a hidden forest called the world economy. Existed a grand banana tree, that fed all the woodland critters.

The tree's system is simple, yet beautiful. 

Economy tree drops bananas on the hard working critters of the forest. Then the woodland critters gather the bananas, eat what they need, and the rest fertilizes the tree. Ensuring that bananas will always be plentiful for all who need them, while making sure future critters will have bananas to eat as well.

All was going great until one day.... A greedy hedge troll was trying to get more bananas from the tree so he could hord them, because he feels inadequate without having way more bananas than he could ever eat in 1000 lifetimes. So he used his short ladder to climb up higher than the other creatures and grab more bananas before they could fall to the critters.

This system was greedy, but the woodland critters ignored it because they didn't want to deal with the hedge troll. For he was a total dick.

Eventually the hedge troll decided he needed even more bananas, because he wanted enough to climb his banana mountain to space, but he didn't want to have to climb any more. So he kicked the tree out of frustration.

To his surprise, a bunch of bananas fell from the tree from the impact of his kick.

The hedge troll was elated and kept on kicking the tree for more bananas, hording them away. Until eventually, he realized ""Oh my! If kicking the economy tree knocks down bananas.... then fucking it is bound to knock down even more!""

Excited. The hedge troll pulls down his ""Naked shorts"" leaving him uncovered, and starts fucking the hell out of the economy tree. Causing bunches and bunches of bananas to rain down.

Now the economy tree can only grow so many bananas at a time. So the rest of the woodland critters were starving, living banana to banana. Just trying to get by because the economy tree was sick from all the non consensual hedge troll fucking. 

All while being told by the older woodland critters who had previously gathered many bananas to store for the future when the economy tree was healthy, that they were just not trying hard enough to gather their own bananas. 

""Perhaps you spend too much on Avocado Toast and gadgets. Or you should just work multiple banana gathering jobs to feed yourself.""

These older woodland creatures are idiots and will not be important to the rest of this story. It's just important to mention that they suck.

Naturally, the dumb forest critters blamed immigrants and poor critters for the problem. Instead of actually trying to identify and fix the real problem.

Of course the hedge ape didn't care. He wanted to have more bananas than any one else in the world, so he kept fucking the economy tree to his greedy little hearts content. All while hording all of the bananas to himself. Refusing to report the bananas on his banana taxes.

Lucky for the critters of the wood. A wise ape, who is definitely not a cat, named DFV, was off looking for bananas one day when he saw the hedge troll humping the economy tree.

""Well thats not right."" DFV said as he watched the hedge troll. ""Fucking the economy tree like that is against the rules. It's his fault that so many woodland critters are without a fair share of bananas to eat! This hedge troll is a total dick!"" Wise DFV decided.

Wise ape DFV used his super wrinkle brain to come up with a plan to stop the evil hedge troll from his sinister tree humping ways.

DFV took one of his bananas.... and shoved it right up the hedge trolls ass.

""Holy shit!"" The hedge troll screamed. ""Why did you shove that banana up my ass? I am no Rick from the Spades forest."" But then the hedge troll realized that he had been caught doing something he wasn't supposed to, and was afraid that if the woodland critters found out what he had been doing, he would have to stop fucking the economy tree. Or worse yet... have to return his ill gotten bananas!

Panicked. The hedge troll decided to fix the problem the only way he knew how.

He lied. 

""Wha, wha, what I ment to say is..... why did you put that banana in the pocket of my shorts?... which have my ass covered of course. In fact they have had my ass covered since January.""

Smart DFV did not believe this lie of course. For his brain was wrinkled and his hands were puuuuure diamond.

""You are lying you silly hedge troll. This banana is in your ass because you have to be naked to fuck the economy tree, and your shorts can not cover your ass while you are fucking the economy tree."" Wise DFV continued ""Which means you are fucking the economy tree for your own selfish gain while other woodland critters suffer as a result. Now if you stop fucking the economy tree, and buy this butt banana off of me for ten good bananas, I will take this banana out of your ass.""

""NEVER!"" Yelled the hedge troll, while other apes who heard the commotion gathered around to see what the wise DFV ape was doing. ""There is no banana up my ass. I will never buy your banana. I'm just climbing this tree for my hard earned bananas like every one else.""

Some of the other diamond handed apes saw through the hedge trolls lies, despite many of them being retarded, and joined wise DFV. Happily shoving their own bananas up the hedge troll's naked uncovered ass and demanding their own ten bananas.

The hedge troll continued to lie. Claiming that the bananas were not worth anything and refused to buy them. All while continuing to fuck the daylights out of the economy tree.

Annoyed. The apes demanded more bananas in payment. All while shoving more of their hard earned bananas up the ass of the hedge troll.

Now all the smooth brained, diamond handed, apes spend their days proving again and again that the hedge troll is fucking economy, until eventually no more bananas can fit in the hedge trolls ass. Causing his ass to explode in an event the apes call the ""MOASS"".

All the while. The other woodland critters refused to believe the apes. ""He couldn't be fucking the economy tree. The media fish from the main stream said he didn't and we believe them.""

Little did they know, the media fish were friends of the hedge ape, who would give them bananas to distract the woodland critters from his evil deeds.

The apes refused to quit. Since they knew they were right they soldered on. Gathering more and more bananas to shove deep into the hedge troll's ass.

Now children... I am sad to tell you that this story is not yet finished.... The final chapter is still being written, but I can tell you how I think it will go.

Soon. The hedge troll will be forced to stop fucking the economy tree, and buy the bananas out of his ass with his whole horde of stashed bananas or just explode in the great fortold ""MOASS"". Which will result in the whole forest again have a fair and equal share of the the economy trees banana bounty while the brave diamond apes celebrate on the moon with their lambos.

# 0. Summary

This is a play I fortunately picked up from [an esteemed redditor's profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/Undercover_in_SF/comments/pg3s2e/). It has flown under the radar (until yesterday), and just recently (today) the Market Cap of $1.61b was [published on MarketWatch](https://marketwatch.com/investing/stock/irnt), making it eligible for that sweet, mindless, retail pile on that we all know so well.

To be clear, this is a gamma squeeze play. Yes, I know, squeezes are gay. However, they've [treated me quite nicely in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvp67v/rkt_compelling_options_chain_1b_buyback_great/) and I don't mind gambling on another. **This easily has the best set-up for a gamma squeeze that I've seen.** I look at gamma ramp charts every day for all types of tickers I come across, and I've never seen anything this extreme before. (I have a screener for ""interesting gamma ramps"" but this slipped by due to having an unknown market cap, because I scrape from Yahoo Finance and Marketwatch and not from analyzing filings and doing math.)

This is a bet that the catalyst that whale(s) are betting on is realized, and/or that retail piles on, and that MMs deltahedging will multiply the effects of either of those.

Yes, today it already peaked. I don't even know what the catalyst for that was, but I don't think this is fully on retail's radar yet and believe there's a lot more demand coming.


# 1. The Set-up

## August (Phase 1)

As explained (much better) in [the original DD](https://www.reddit.com/user/Undercover_in_SF/comments/pg3s2e/), this was a SPAC. Pre-acquisition, the SPAC had enough float/marketcap/whatever for CBOE to list some options on it.

Then, the SPAC went forth with the acquisition and redeemed 90% of the god damn float. Normally a stock with this low amount of float would not be allowed to have options listed -- but since it was already listed, what could they do?

Next, a whale entered. Extremely bullish calls purchased resulting in a pre-built gamma ramp and also tying up an (approximated) 40% of the remaining float. (This value is obviously not accurate, but compared to other tickers also-inaccurate figures, it is very high. More on that later.)

What was left was a stock with *extremely low float*, and *a whale-built gamma ramp*.

## Yesterday (Phase 2)

Yesterday an esteemed redditor put together these pieces and [posted a DD to their own profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/Undercover_in_SF/comments/pg3s2e/), as no other sub-reddits would have them.

This lead to some relatively light (by WSB standards) options activity on it midday. The price jolted up 10% as a result. This is from a single DD on a user's profile that was crosslinked to a couple of small sub-reddits.

In total, probably about 150 upvotes worth of eyeballs were on it... and as a result it moved 10% up in a matter of hours.

To me, this proves that this stock is highly reflexive to inflows of options/shares, has a compelling DD behind it, and that I want lotto tickets in case there's any catalyst whatsoever, including retail FOMO.

## Today (Phase 3)

Early in the day there was some inflow, gamma took off, and this thing was halted. It spiked up and immediately came crashing down. IVs got jacked up to the roof but have now stabilized to somewhat sensible levels. The stock remains up 15% for the day.. indicating to me this thing is not done yet.

**Also today, Market Watch now shows the market cap ($1.14b), making this stock eligible for the big leagues; right here.** That's phase 3. Mainstream.

What we now have is a stock with *extremely low float*, a whale-built gamma ramp, proof that small retail buy-in can drastically effect the price, and visibility on WSB.

## Catalyst

High gamma doesn't mean shit without a catalyst. What's the catalyst this time? Well, whatever the original whale was betting on... I don't fucking know.

Also, and more realistically, it's retail buy-in. It could be this post, honestly. (Recommendation: If IV gets too high, do not fucking buy!)

In short, this estimates how many shares MMs will have to buy to deltahedge against all the options on the chain. It's an approximation, because it makes the following (incorrect) assumptions:

1. All options on the chain are delta hedged against...
2. via black-scholes model using the implied vol...
3. continuously.

None of these are likely to be true. However, the chart is useful for comparing against other tickers and other scenarios. In other words, the extent that the delta/gamma values are inexact are probably similar across tickers.

**The values for IRNT are far beyond anything I've seen before.** When GME/RKT had their gamma squeezes, the gamma (which I measure as how many shares need to be delta hedged per a 1% price move) was around 1.00% of float.

The values for IRNT are &gt;1.50% of float all the way out to $22.00/sh -- peaking at 2.71%. Fucking insane.

This means that if the share price moves 1%, MMs will (in theory) need to buy a *shit ton* of shares to remain delta neutral.  Will they do this?  Yesterdays price action seems to indicate as much. An inflow of options activity cause the price to jump up 10%, and this was only from a few very low-visibility posts around reddit, totaling maying 200 upvotes.

Another value, *net delta*, is extremely high already. About 95% of the remaining float is held by MMs to remain delta neutral (again, in theory, and an approximation). This is about the levels that GME/RKT were prior to them mooning. They were actually a bit less. And, again, this is not a precise estimate -- but qualitatively compared to all the ramps I look at, it's *very* high up there.

Now, for reference, here is GME's current gamma ramp:

## Conclusion

I've never seen a ticker with this much gamma. I'm still in.

# 3. How Does This Play Out?

A gamma ramp by itself only indicates that the stock can move with extreme volatility in regions where gamma is high. This is due to MMs ""mirroring"" inflows/outflows to delta hedge. Stock goes up, they buy more. Stock goes down, they sell more. For IRNT, the regions of high gamma are basically *any price*, since the float is so damn low and the OI is so high.

What is needed for a gamma squeeze to occur is an actual catalyst. MMs need to be forced to deltahedge upward. If they start to see real volatility they'll be forced to deltahedge. If share price goes up from inflows, they'll need to deltahedge.

They'll then buy shares against their best interest cause the price go up more, causing more deltahedging, etc. I believe retail inflows will be that catalyst -- and if not, I'm piggybacking on the whale.

**Keep in mind value is not created out of thin air.** The stock isn't magically worth more because there is low liquidity and a lot of open interest in options. The ""value"" is that MMs are likely not charging enough for premiums given how low liquidity is. Their loss is our gain.

If MMs are not deltahedging aggressively enough, then as ITM calls approach expiration they will be forced to buy shares and bump the price up further.

Eventually MMs will raise IVs to the point where they no longer need to hedge and can try to ride the volatility back down and recoup their losses.

So I'll repeat what I've said before: **When IV too high, do not buy.** If IV is high, you missed it. Wait for the next one.

This alreayd spiked once today. I've waited to see what happens, and now that it's stabilized I still believe the untapped masses will shoot this thing off again, and much higher than before.

# 4. My Play

I'm going in and out purely based on IV, as I believe once MMs get paid too much (eg: get paid on an IV that far exceeds actual volatility) the gamma bomb gets diffused because MMs will stop deltahedging. If they collect high premiums on OTM calls, for example, they can comfortable sit back and wait for those to become worthless. They're in no rush to deltahedge as they've pretty much already priced in the worse case scenario of insane volatility.

My target is for Sep 17 calls to hit 250-300% IV, then I'm out.

I sold some during today's first spike, then rebought in now.

**This is high risk, high reward.**

This company has a market cap of 1.58b according to marketwatch.com

""None of the subs I'm active on will take a post on this one since the market cap is too low. I've got to share it with someone, so the 57 of you following me directly may or may not see this.

To start with, I am super skeptical of anything that mentions the word ""squeeze."" Post-GME, it became a way to lure in suckers to be holding the dump after your pump. However, either this is going to be an honest to God gamma squeeze, or I've missed something big time.

Here's the background. DFNS, a pretty good SPAC sponsor actually, acquired IronNet Cyber Security. However, 90% of the shares were redeemed last week. This brought the total float down to 1.2M shares. In addition, 1.5M shares from management were unlocked, giving us a total 2.7M shares available to trade.

Usually, options trading requires a much higher float than this. The CBOE requires a 7M share float (technically, 7M shares owned by holders without reporting requirements), and 2.4M shares traded in the last 12 months before allowing options trading. $IRNT is far below that, but before redemptions DFNS wasn't. This has created a bit of a hole in the CBOE liquidity rulebook.

What does that mean for us? Well, there are a huge number of options being traded and a huge OI growing by the day. There are something like 40k total call options outstanding and more than 30k in September expiries alone, and there's also been almost no retail interest either on Reddit or Twitter. I see a few reasons for that - market cap rules, the ticker change creates a delay in data for stock screeners to start finding it, and there have been plenty of other exciting meme trades over the last week. To me that means we're looking at smart money accumulating options with the intention of driving a gamma squeeze. Once retail catches on, they'll maintain the momentum and be left holding the bag.

Let's do a deeper dive on what these calls represent relative to the float. I've looked at September calls only and pulled the latest OI from CBOE. That data is below.

[https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9](https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9)

Remember that puts have the exact opposite hedging behavior as calls, so I've netted them out and included their impact on gamma as well. Currently, 31% of the float is tied up hedging these long calls. On top of that, a $1 increase in the underlying price will drive net buying of \~11% of the float in order to maintain delta-neutrality. In addition, gamma will increase and the net hedging will accelerate as the $17.5 and $20 strikes get closer to in the money. This gives us a price around $17 where there aren't enough shares to hedge the outstanding pool of call options and we get a gamma squeeze.

Conversely, this option pricing effect can be just as dramatic on the downside as the upside. If the price falls below $10, expect most of the 400k shares represented by the $12.5 strikes to add to selling pressure.

There is one major assumption we're making here - that all these trades are unilateral with the market maker and the market maker is taking the short side of that trade. That's almost certainly not true, but I believe it's fair to assume the majority are.

In summary, I *think* we are watching one or more hedge funds set up for a dramatic spike in share price caused by market dynamics. Similarly, I think now is the time to invest alongside them to get a quick 4-5x return. I view this as extremely speculative, so I've only got \~$2k of exposure in $20 strike September calls, but I may increase that in the coming days.

I'll end with a request. If you have information that disproves this thesis please share it. I have been looking for contradictory evidence, but have found very little.

Edit:

From their latest 8-K filed today. Post merger, there were 84,423,567 shares outstanding. 66,160,197 are subject to a lockup. 12,500,000 were PIPE shares that are not yet registered and not yet tradable, and 3.2M shares that are locked up except for charitable donations. The exact numbers are below.

[https://preview.redd.it/kak6phy0vzk71.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=738ab4508c91af5280dc8255017c54f5cd8e8f76](https://preview.redd.it/kak6phy0vzk71.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=738ab4508c91af5280dc8255017c54f5cd8e8f76)

The next shares that are expected to be tradable are the 1,078,125 incentive shares that are awarded to legacy shareholders if the stock price exceeds $13 for 10 consecutive days. The earliest that could be is September 9th. If this goes off, it will be before the 9th.

Edit #2:

I'm now fairly confident the incentive shares are subject to the lockup, so until registration of the PIPE shares, we're looking at 2.5M float plus whatever has been gifted to charity. Warrants can't convert for another 30 days, so those are also not a threat at the moment.""",True,False,False,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,10797111,public,confidence,self,$IRNT - IronNet Cyber Security - an actual gamma squeeze candidate?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ph9pue/irnt_ironnet_cyber_security_an_actual_gamma/,some_ads,7,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'M7jab38ZOwVHKvXy2yLiP8qXJvgO4SnaVpcuNr0tb1o', 'resolutions': [{'height': 63, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SibTfIgq7ys7feFng8_ZN0uhhb0TZ3sLJdBbVKtEQnY.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fef56f0dfbff388906424c32b24bbfe41bd1a59e', 'width': 108}, {'height': 126, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SibTfIgq7ys7feFng8_ZN0uhhb0TZ3sLJdBbVKtEQnY.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86e5ba5c56ad7bde11a58cd60e66fe89ba9fde4d', 'width': 216}, {'height': 187, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SibTfIgq7ys7feFng8_ZN0uhhb0TZ3sLJdBbVKtEQnY.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81f7026a12ef11b58683856278a5c274e16afaf4', 'width': 320}, {'height': 374, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SibTfIgq7ys7feFng8_ZN0uhhb0TZ3sLJdBbVKtEQnY.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34d267291d5983fdd98cef4ee115de0634a14f6e', 'width': 640}, {'height': 562, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SibTfIgq7ys7feFng8_ZN0uhhb0TZ3sLJdBbVKtEQnY.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=707a0656d9d18da4b910895fb092185fdf5e236b', 'width': 960}, {'height': 632, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SibTfIgq7ys7feFng8_ZN0uhhb0TZ3sLJdBbVKtEQnY.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd27cf90ba511eb339ba1482c2962cbf7c199527', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1057, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SibTfIgq7ys7feFng8_ZN0uhhb0TZ3sLJdBbVKtEQnY.png?auto=webp&amp;s=af4559efb76dfc3e0957e74e350c01e9647f9fac', 'width': 1805}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This company has a market cap of 1.58b according to marketwatch.com

""None of the subs I'm active on will take a post on this one since the market cap is too low. I've got to share it with someone, so the 57 of you following me directly may or may not see this.

To start with, I am super skeptical of anything that mentions the word ""squeeze."" Post-GME, it became a way to lure in suckers to be holding the dump after your pump. However, either this is going to be an honest to God gamma squeeze, or I've missed something big time.

Here's the background. DFNS, a pretty good SPAC sponsor actually, acquired IronNet Cyber Security. However, 90% of the shares were redeemed last week. This brought the total float down to 1.2M shares. In addition, 1.5M shares from management were unlocked, giving us a total 2.7M shares available to trade.

Usually, options trading requires a much higher float than this. The CBOE requires a 7M share float (technically, 7M shares owned by holders without reporting requirements), and 2.4M shares traded in the last 12 months before allowing options trading. $IRNT is far below that, but before redemptions DFNS wasn't. This has created a bit of a hole in the CBOE liquidity rulebook.

What does that mean for us? Well, there are a huge number of options being traded and a huge OI growing by the day. There are something like 40k total call options outstanding and more than 30k in September expiries alone, and there's also been almost no retail interest either on Reddit or Twitter. I see a few reasons for that - market cap rules, the ticker change creates a delay in data for stock screeners to start finding it, and there have been plenty of other exciting meme trades over the last week. To me that means we're looking at smart money accumulating options with the intention of driving a gamma squeeze. Once retail catches on, they'll maintain the momentum and be left holding the bag.

Let's do a deeper dive on what these calls represent relative to the float. I've looked at September calls only and pulled the latest OI from CBOE. That data is below.

https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9

Remember that puts have the exact opposite hedging behavior as calls, so I've netted them out and included their impact on gamma as well. Currently, 31% of the float is tied up hedging these long calls. On top of that, a $1 increase in the underlying price will drive net buying of ~11% of the float in order to maintain delta-neutrality. In addition, gamma will increase and the net hedging will accelerate as the $17.5 and $20 strikes get closer to in the money. This gives us a price around $17 where there aren't enough shares to hedge the outstanding pool of call options and we get a gamma squeeze.

Conversely, this option pricing effect can be just as dramatic on the downside as the upside. If the price falls below $10, expect most of the 400k shares represented by the $12.5 strikes to add to selling pressure.

There is one major assumption we're making here - that all these trades are unilateral with the market maker and the market maker is taking the short side of that trade. That's almost certainly not true, but I believe it's fair to assume the majority are.

In summary, I think we are watching one or more hedge funds set up for a dramatic spike in share price caused by market dynamics. Similarly, I think now is the time to invest alongside them to get a quick 4-5x return. I view this as extremely speculative, so I've only got ~$2k of exposure in $20 strike September calls, but I may increase that in the coming days.

I'll end with a request. If you have information that disproves this thesis please share it. I have been looking for contradictory evidence, but have found very little.

Edit:

From their latest 8-K filed today. Post merger, there were 84,423,567 shares outstanding. 66,160,197 are subject to a lockup. 12,500,000 were PIPE shares that are not yet registered and not yet tradable, and 3.2M shares that are locked up except for charitable donations.

@ Mods: Market Cap of Ticker is $1.14b

""None of the subs I'm active on will take a post on this one since the market cap is too low. I've got to share it with someone, so the 57 of you following me directly may or may not see this.

To start with, I am super skeptical of anything that mentions the word ""squeeze."" Post-GME, it became a way to lure in suckers to be holding the dump after your pump. However, either this is going to be an honest to God gamma squeeze, or I've missed something big time.

Here's the background. DFNS, a pretty good SPAC sponsor actually, acquired IronNet Cyber Security. However, 90% of the shares were redeemed last week. This brought the total float down to 1.2M shares. In addition, 1.5M shares from management were unlocked, giving us a total 2.7M shares available to trade.

Usually, options trading requires a much higher float than this. The CBOE requires a 7M share float (technically, 7M shares owned by holders without reporting requirements), and 2.4M shares traded in the last 12 months before allowing options trading. $IRNT is far below that, but before redemptions DFNS wasn't. This has created a bit of a hole in the CBOE liquidity rulebook.

What does that mean for us? Well, there are a huge number of options being traded and a huge OI growing by the day. There are something like 40k total call options outstanding and more than 30k in September expiries alone, and there's also been almost no retail interest either on Reddit or Twitter. I see a few reasons for that - market cap rules, the ticker change creates a delay in data for stock screeners to start finding it, and there have been plenty of other exciting meme trades over the last week. To me that means we're looking at smart money accumulating options with the intention of driving a gamma squeeze. Once retail catches on, they'll maintain the momentum and be left holding the bag.

Let's do a deeper dive on what these calls represent relative to the float. I've looked at September calls only and pulled the latest OI from CBOE. That data is below.

https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9

Remember that puts have the exact opposite hedging behavior as calls, so I've netted them out and included their impact on gamma as well. Currently, 31% of the float is tied up hedging these long calls. On top of that, a $1 increase in the underlying price will drive net buying of ~11% of the float in order to maintain delta-neutrality. In addition, gamma will increase and the net hedging will accelerate as the $17.5 and $20 strikes get closer to in the money. This gives us a price around $17 where there aren't enough shares to hedge the outstanding pool of call options and we get a gamma squeeze.

Conversely, this option pricing effect can be just as dramatic on the downside as the upside. If the price falls below $10, expect most of the 400k shares represented by the $12.5 strikes to add to selling pressure.

There is one major assumption we're making here - that all these trades are unilateral with the market maker and the market maker is taking the short side of that trade. That's almost certainly not true, but I believe it's fair to assume the majority are.

In summary, I *think* we are watching one or more hedge funds set up for a dramatic spike in share price caused by market dynamics. Similarly, I think now is the time to invest alongside them to get a quick 4-5x return. I view this as extremely speculative, so I've only got ~$2k of exposure in $20 strike September calls, but I may increase that in the coming days.

I'll end with a request. If you have information that disproves this thesis please share it. I have been looking for contradictory evidence, but have found very little.

Edit:

From their latest 8-K filed today. Post merger, there were 84,423,567 shares outstanding. 66,160,197 are subject to a lockup. 12,500,000 were PIPE shares that are not yet registered and not yet tradable, and 3.2M shares that are locked up except for charitable donations. The exact numbers are below.

https://preview.redd.it/kak6phy0vzk71.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=738ab4508c91af5280dc8255017c54f5cd8e8f76

The next shares that are expected to be tradable are the 1,078,125 incentive shares that are awarded to legacy shareholders if the stock price exceeds $13 for 10 consecutive days. The earliest that could be is September 9th. If this goes off, it will be before the 9th.

Edit #2:

I'm now fairly confident the incentive shares are subject to the lockup, so until registration of the PIPE shares, we're looking at 2.5M float plus whatever has been gifted to charity. Warrants can't convert for another 30 days, so those are also not a threat at the moment.""",False,False,False,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,10796250,public,confidence,self,$IRNT - IronNet Cyber Security - an actual gamma squeeze candidate?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ph4iam/irnt_ironnet_cyber_security_an_actual_gamma/,some_ads,7,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'M7jab38ZOwVHKvXy2yLiP8qXJvgO4SnaVpcuNr0tb1o', 'resolutions': [{'height': 63, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SibTfIgq7ys7feFng8_ZN0uhhb0TZ3sLJdBbVKtEQnY.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fef56f0dfbff388906424c32b24bbfe41bd1a59e', 'width': 108}, {'height': 126, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SibTfIgq7ys7feFng8_ZN0uhhb0TZ3sLJdBbVKtEQnY.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86e5ba5c56ad7bde11a58cd60e66fe89ba9fde4d', 'width': 216}, {'height': 187, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SibTfIgq7ys7feFng8_ZN0uhhb0TZ3sLJdBbVKtEQnY.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81f7026a12ef11b58683856278a5c274e16afaf4', 'width': 320}, {'height': 374, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SibTfIgq7ys7feFng8_ZN0uhhb0TZ3sLJdBbVKtEQnY.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34d267291d5983fdd98cef4ee115de0634a14f6e', 'width': 640}, {'height': 562, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SibTfIgq7ys7feFng8_ZN0uhhb0TZ3sLJdBbVKtEQnY.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=707a0656d9d18da4b910895fb092185fdf5e236b', 'width': 960}, {'height': 632, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SibTfIgq7ys7feFng8_ZN0uhhb0TZ3sLJdBbVKtEQnY.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd27cf90ba511eb339ba1482c2962cbf7c199527', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1057, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SibTfIgq7ys7feFng8_ZN0uhhb0TZ3sLJdBbVKtEQnY.png?auto=webp&amp;s=af4559efb76dfc3e0957e74e350c01e9647f9fac', 'width': 1805}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hear-hear!, autists and retards, Uranium is heating up to make all of you, as many trendies as you desire. 

Many have been following the industry, for years or months, and are witnessing the coming explosion of ALL companies Uranium. And they are fucking excited.  BULLs did not think SPROTT would move the market with such ease. Which it is doing, with Canadian rupees. 

Do you remember last year, posts about lumber, mattresses, or shipping, but ended up buying black berry and weed stocks?? Well this is your chance to make up for that horrible decision your wife left you over. 

Some of these stocks will 3-5x, and nano caps could 10x. 

The market cap of the industry is around 30BN---ITS 20 PERCENT OF NORTH AMERICAN BASELOAD POWER. This is chicken shit, even to the europoors. This market can be moved very easily, and its fully underway. 

The industry has been killed by the utility companies who has been buying cheap Uranium, well guess what….that is over now. Their contacts are up, and SPROTT is buying up all that cheap Yellow Cake for their fat boomer investors.  Game theory, simple, drive up the spot price is a thin market. 

Unlike other metals, it is virtually impossible manipulate, thorough paper, imitation, or recycling—once it leaves storage it is SPENT. Gone, good buy---they need more, or the power goes out, not an option.

This will be the easiest and probably only 10 bagger many will ever experience. You will have plenty of chances to take profits, and you will exit based on the price of U. 

There are smarter contributors who have provided the economics for those that can read. 

below, 

last Uranium bull run, 05--U P C, was a fund used to buy physical Uranium, ran by SPROTT. yes they are doing it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Bear case: Nuclear disaster, should mention, this is a cyclical play—you have to sell before it comes down—that can be determined by spot price. This is not amazon in 2000s. 

Serious money will move in soon, my guess is we are entering midcycle, still early. Liken this to buying GME at 20. 

Positions

CCJ leaps. 

DO NOT MENTION TICKERS WITH SMALL MARKET CAPS.

🔥💥🔥💥HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP 🔥👍💰💵💎💎

OK LET ME SET THE PRIMARY EXAMPLE THAT DEMONSTRATES MY POINT-
THE AMC  SHORT SQUEEZE NEEDED RETAILERS TO BYE AND HOLD ROUGHLY 511MIL FLOAT SHARES.  THIS NUMBER IS 10× THE NUMBER OF SHARES NEEDED TO PUT THE SQUEEZE ON GLOBAL BEAM WHICH HAS A FLOAT OF 7.55mil.

ACCORDING TO ""THE MARKET WATCH"" WHICH MAINTAINS A CURRENT LIST OF THE MOST HEAVILY SHORTED STOCKS IN THE STOCK MARKET. 🔥💎 BEAM GLOBAL IS LISTED AS THE NUMBER FIVE MOST SHORTED STOCKS IN THE MARKET!!!🔥💎 

WE HAVE HUGE OPPORTUNITY SITTING RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES! YET ALL I HEAR IS CHATTER THAT IS NOT MOVING FORWARD THE ENTIRE CONCEPT OF WSB...FIND SHORTED STOCKS AND FUCK THE SHORTIES WITH OUR NUMBERS AND TAKE THEIR GOD DAMN MONEY!.

PLEASE SOMEBODY LISTEN AND HELP ME PROMOTE THE EXECUTION OF THIS....💵🔥💰




QUITE SIMPLY THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF SHARES THAT WOULD MAKE THIS SO EASY TO ACCOMPLISH COMPARED TO THE OTHER FOR MENTIONED OBVIOUS SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED SQUEEZES!  


BEAM GLOBAL IS A GROWING AND SOLID EV COMPANY THAT IS A COMPLETE BUY.  SO NOT ONLY WOULD YOU BE CREATING A SERIOUS GROWTH IN SHARE PRICE BUT IT'S ALSO A SERIOUS LONG TERM INVESTMENT IF YOU LIKE.  💥THE SQUEEZE IS JUST A BONUS GUYS!💥

THIS INFORMATION USED HERE PERTAINNG TO THE FLOATED AND SHORTED SHARES COMES FROM ""
  
WSB MEMBERS- WHY DO I NOT SEE PLANS AND DISCUSSIONS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS TIME ORIENTED OPPORTUNITY???  CAN WE CONTINUE THE LEGITIMATE BATTLE AGAINST THE HEGGIES BY MOVING FORWARD BY CREATING MORE SQUEEZES SUCH AS THE ONE I JUST MENTIONED WHICH COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED SO QUICKLY COMPARED TO WHAT WSB HAS ACCOMPLISHED IN THE PAST?

THE NUMBERS ADD UP FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FIRE UP WSB MEMBERS TO ORGANIZE TO MAKE THIS AMAZING OPPORTUNITY A REALITY. 

I'M SO FRUSTRATED BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF AWARENESS OF THE SIMPLICITY OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SQUASH THE SHORTIES AND MAKE DAMN GOOD MONEY AT THE SAME TIME! !
CAN WE PLEASE CONTINUE WHAT WSB WAS CREATED FOR? JUMP ON NEW OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS THIS??  MAYBE I MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT WSB IS. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE CONCEPT OF ORGANIZING RETAILERS SUCH AS MYSELF TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE MARKET IN A WAY THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO ALONE.
I HAVE NOT CHECKED OUT WSB FOR A FEW MONTHS AND IT SURPRISED ME TO SEE SO MANY POSTS AND CONVERSATIONS ON WSB REGARDING AMC AND GSE INSTEAD OF A LOT OF CHATTER ABOUT WHAT TO DO NEXT. IT SEEMS LIKE WSB EXISTS FOR THOSE TWO BATTLES AND IS FULL OF RETAILERS THAT ARE NOT TRYING TO CONTINUE ITS PURPOSE- ORGANIZE TO CREATE POWER VIA NUMBERS, THUS  CHANGES IN THE MARKET THAT BENEFIT THE INDIVIDUALS CAN SUDDENLY BE MONETIZED! 

THIS POST WILL BE IN VAIN  BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH RHETORIC AND CONCERN FOR TOPICS OTHER THAN TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT VIA ORGANIZATION OTHER THAN AMC GME.
LOOK AT THE FIGURES THAT SHOW FLOAT FIGURES ABOVE! WSB COULD ACCOMPLISH THE SQUEEZE IN NO TIME COMPARED TO THE FLOATS FOR AMC!  INCREDIBLY EASIER THAN AMC OR GME!

But, can you blame their excitement? Wall Street, and WSB get more excited about a disrupting, green, or new tech company than a lesbian visiting phra nang cave. This one is exciting. We've all seen the DD, 140% beat on revenue.

The kicker? They've double their counties served this quarter from the last. That's only about 70 counties. Incase you were wondering, there's over 3000 in the country. AI taking care of healthcare insurance, come on, if Chamath wasn't involved, your tits would be jacked. 

What do I have new to add?

Doing my daily rounds, just waiting for the next short report to come out on the 10th, I noticed this. Couldn't be right, so I hopped over to iBorrowdesk.

&amp;#x200B;

[WTF?](https://preview.redd.it/8n2iczfgccm71.png?width=234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3cad9893b15a2c9fd0a7a57558c2a1b867498fd)

So, I decided to check Ortex. Ortex lags on cost to borrow, but they do monitor borrowed and returned shares, at least the data that's publicly available.

&amp;#x200B;

[Ortex Estimated SI, more borrowed than returned.](https://preview.redd.it/drepkkpmccm71.png?width=447&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e1b6ac9f5584475cfcc50f87012877de340e4d7)

Did the shorts go stop loss hunting? Why the spike in borrow fee? Maybe they hoped we were still as dumb as our early GME days, and they could drop it like a father holding a baby on Maury, just finding out he is NOT the father. Shorts are cornering themselves again. And I have a feeling Chamath has been moving the pieces around, to make the float appear more than it actually is. The floor has been met, and I expect a nice bounce tomorrow. Can't wait for the short report!

OR. I could be an idiot. It's much more likely.

4. This quarter is traditionally $GME's weakest quarter

# Part 0: Intro

Sup freaks. Just came back from the moon and that shit is glorious. Here to officially introduce you to a play I’ve been loading up on for weeks. The company is Genius Sports Limited, ticker $GENI, aka GENIE, or as Forrest Gump would say Jennaaaaay. You may be wondering why I’m here? I’m clearly (newly) rich, I should get a life. The answer is simple. I’m a degenerate and it's short hunting season. Pow Pow. The FUD’r of interest is forensic bitch and noted short seller Spruce Point Capital Management. These guys are incredibly ***unsuccessful*** in their calls so I take this as a major bull flag that they released a short report on GENI. Spruce’s past successes include: MGNI (moon shot/money printer), DBX (DropBox), Nova (rose 88% after their post, talk about poor timing). These guys have the Midas Touch, ***anything their*** ***fungus filled fingernails*** ***stroke eventually end up moonshotting***; I’m here to expedite the process. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Genius Sports Limited (GENI) is a tech company that collects data from sports events, processes it, and sells it to major gambling companies to run their sportsbooks (SKLZ, DKNG, Fanduel, Caesars etc). They are the [pick &amp; shovel](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pick-and-shovel-play.asp) play of a rapidly growing sports gambling segment ([gambling record $44bn in revenue 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/08/10/us-gambling-revenue-to--break-44-billion-record-in-2021/)). They have 4 competitors (large moat) but only Sportradar offers any real competition. GENI has deals with NASCAR, MLB, NBA, NCAA and the English Premier League amongst others. They are also the [official data partner of the NFL](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/nfl-agrees-to-data-rights-deal-with-genius-sports.html) holding exclusive rights; dump truck sized moat. Prominent investors include Cathie Wood, Mrs “Average Down at all Costs”, Anpanaman “God Tier SPAC Wizard &amp; [wsb Yolo’r](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyjk9i/geni_spruce_point_smash_grab_shorts_disclose_your/) (1.1m+ [😳](https://emojipedia.org/flushed-face/))”, amongst others (institutional ownership is 90%+). But, before we get into more specifics about the company + setup please watch this educational video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDWgqDBNXA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDWgqDBNXA)

Yup, I also love Christina Aguilera. So, gals put on your crop top and cargo pants, and fellas that backward fitted &amp; baggy jeans. Let’s get groovy 90s style. Oh and Christina, please slide in my DM.

# Part 1: Fundamentals

GENI is the backbone/infrastructure play on sports betting since they supply the  data that major gambling companies use.  GENI offers a suite of four products:

* **GeniusLive**: this is a vertically integrated video service that allows teams or sports leagues to launch something like NBA League Pass. So the platform supports payments, live statistics, advertising, live streaming, and video on-demand, without having to buy a bunch of extra software/hardware. 
* **Sporttech:** Data capture, management and analysis tools that help leagues run their sport, unlock new revenue streams, and protect the integrity of their competitions. This is essentially the shit that has turned Facebook from some site used to scam on girls in  college into a company with revenues of over $10B a year. GENI collects all the data from degenerate bets, and provides the information gathered from them to their partners for future use. 
* **Sportsbook:** GENI provides the capability (but not requirement) to build out an entire sportsbook platform for their partners.  This provides all the benefits of having a sportsbook with none of the risk of spending capital on a field GENI partners are unfamiliar with.
* **Media &amp; Engagement:**  GENI has the platform capabilities to allow their partners sports betting experience to enter into the world of social media.  You can chat in real time with other sports betters and complain that Nick Chubb stepped out at the 1 yard line and completely boned your 3 bet parlay. Through this platform GENI can leverage their fan engagement capabilities to drive advertising revenue and also promote future bets that may be to your liking based on your prior activity.

As  mentioned Genie’s only real competition in this space is Sportradar, but Sportradar’s [SPAC merger fell through](https://www.casino.org/news/sportradar-filed-for-a-highly-anticipated-ipo-on-tuesday/) after GENI swooped the exclusive rights to the NFL from under them -- ya know, the ole’ Bulgarian ambush perfected by Vlad. 

The NFL deal is pretty significant so let’s dive into it: 

* **Expensive af**: Genius will [pay the NFL $120 million a year over six years](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/), with half paid in warrants making the [NFL own roughly 5% of GENI](https://www.yahoo.com/now/nfl-stake-genius-nearly-15-215504358.html). 
* **Locked in profit**:  Sportradar was pulling in 1.5% to 2% of in-play gross gaming revenue (GGR) on NFL wagers \[[source](https://sportshandle.com/sportradar-genius-nfl-data/)\].  Genius decided to go the opposite route by jacking up rates; asking for around 4% of operators’ pre-match NFL betting revenues and 6% of in-play \[[source](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/)\]. Operators are big mad about this:

&gt;*""They don’t really have anything new,” said another operator exec. “They are charging 4x for the same dataset.”*

These guys are forced to use Genie’s official NFL Data either because they are official partners of the NFL (FanDuel, DraftKings, Caesar), state regulations require use of official data, or the TV networks force them to subscribe to Genie data to advertise.  As of now, [DraftKings has already partnered with GENI in a multi year deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/05/draftkings-partners-with-genius-sports-for-sports-betting.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1628161383), PointsBet, WynnBet, BetMGM, Caesars, and Fox Bet have also signed deals w/ Genius ([NFL names Fox Bet, PointsBet, BetMGM and WynnBet as Approved Sportsbook Operators](https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/12973/nfl-names-fox-bet-pointsbet-betmgm-and-wynnbet-as-approved-sportsbook-operators)).  This leaves only Fanduel as yet to be disclosed, but likely already signed with Genie. Senior operator exec’s legit crying that [its a monopoly.](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/)lol. Sucks for them, great for us.

* **Sticky**: The Sportradar deal was inked in 2019 and they got cucked in 2021. Sad. GENI is proactively making moves to make the deal last longer than 6yrs by hiring a good amount of NFL vets. Including [Steve Bornstein](https://www.sportico.com/personalities/executives/2021/genius-sports-steve-bornstein-1234637226/), he now leads GENI’s US business. Mans spent a decade at the NFL managing the media strategy, and spent multiple decades at ESPN and ABC.  He also was the CEO of ESPN for a cool min.   
* **NFL shills for GENI**:  This cannot be reinforced enough: the NFL’s chief concern is the integrity of the data provided, and they are entrusting GENI, and ONLY GENI, with that.  They will also force anyone who wants to do business with the NFL to adhere to the NFL’s core integrity policies by [agreeing to license all Official League Data from GENI](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-announces-agreements-with-four-approved-sportsbook-operators)

To put this in simpler terms: the NFL is telling the world -if you want us, you’re gettin’ some GENI.   GENI also issued warrants to the NFL (5% stake in GENI)  meaning when GENI is successful the NFL is successful so they are locked in and incentivized to push GENI to anyone who wants to work with them.  

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/l3e1xpncxbm71.gif

The reason I’m bullish on Genie and jacked with shares/options other than the regular “*it could squeeeeez*e” play which I know, love, and bang the shit out of, and will explain this angle later, is because Genie secured the NFL deal at the perfect time. So, 3 yrs ago the supreme court overturned the ban on sports betting. The NFL has responded by moving its business model towards generating significant amts of revenue through betting. Sucks for Sporttrader, since for most of the time they held the  exclusive rights to NFL data, the [NFL actually considered gambling to be threat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)**😱**, what a bad position to be in going into the gambling golden age.  

The NFL expects to make $270m in revenue from sports-betting this yr, and  NFL execs are super bullish about their future sports betting revenue, here’s a quote from one: *“*You can definitely see the market growing to $1 billion-plus of league opportunity over this decade.*”\[*[*source*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)*\]* 

The ideal sports-gambling legislation, the NFL concluded, would include substantive licensing requirements creating clear and transparent markets that protect consumers. Bets needed to be resolved using the league’s official data (GENI!! - fuck you, pay me.). There had to be prohibitions on betting by insiders and the onus placed on operators to make certain that wasn’t occurring. \[[source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)\] 

So, when I invest I try to think of analogies that speak to me. This lets me invest in a more  logical and clear headed way. I compare this situation to the girl that sat next to you pre-OnlyFans. She used to eat ramen for lunch. A couple years later she has a poodle, a G Wagon, and goes by “Cyrstal like the champagne” instead of Bernice. Yah, she twerking on cam because she found a money printer, the NFL will twerk to online-betting.  Analogy.

The whole industry will be twerking. 

Cathie Wood’s a month before she started yolo’n on Jenaaay estimated x10 increase in domestic sports betting handle (the amount of money wagered by bettors is called “handle”), to $180 billion by 2025 , with revenue’s for the sector projected to sky at a 31% CAGR. 

One reason for this bullish prediction is the New Jersey example; since NJ legalized online sports betting mid-2018, they've seen online handle moon to $15 billion, 1/2 of this took place in 2020. (*Don’t know why people would yolo on sports and* [*not options*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pg9jpn/why_doesnt_everyone_only_trade_options_0_dte_spy/)*, but to each their own lulz*).

Sportsbetting is picking up so much steam, ESPN keeps their own tracker for up to date info on which states are going to let you yolo rent $ on Appalachian State vs Syracuse:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g68ri70exbm71.png?width=1272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95e3af4ca366eb8d64ba23ac0f970d51bdac69b8

There are only 3 states (Utah, Idaho, and Wisconsin - which btw if you live in any of these places - move the fuck out) that do not currently allow for sports betting and/or are in the process of allowing it.  Ground floor opportunity here.

[Earlier this month, Wyoming Awarded Genius Sports Inaugural Sports Betting License - upping the number of states GENI can operate in to 15. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wyoming-awards-genius-sports-inaugural-213000130.html)

So clearly Jenaayy is a growth stock but let’s look at the fundamentals &amp; also how Genie compares to the competition. (Genie, Jenaayy, GENI, Genius … lol sorry I’m  dislexic). Ya so  Sportradar (Genie’s rival)  is slated to go public this year and will likely trade in the $10-12B valuation range \[[article/source](https://www.sportico.com/business/finance/2021/sportradar-ten-billion-valuation-1234623092/)\].

Sportradar filed its S-1 a few weeks ago which provides historical financial performance.  Making some simple assumptions on continued revenue growth (based on historic CAGR) we can figure out Sportradar’s valuation multiples which we’ll compare to Jenaayyy’s.  I’m also throwing in Draftkings in the comparison as a high growth (but unprofitable), pure play sportsbook leader.  You can see below how the financials compare:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1f6alqkfxbm71.png?width=1258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c25a5c75f0ca5b4498d9883053284138e273ec7

I would argue Genie and Sportradar should trade at a premium to Draftkings as they have an effective duopoly on the sports betting data market.  Draftkings’ sports book market is getting more competition from new players, which is causing customer acquisition costs to skyrocket.  HOWEVER, as more of these players enter the market, they’ll have to buy all their official sports data from Jenaayy!  

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/fk2cxfmgxbm71.gif

Let’s get serious for a sec,, below is a valuation comparison and as you can see Genie trades at a discount to DKNG and at a premium to Sportradar’s expected IPO pricing valuation of $26-29 or $7.4B - $8.2B. It’s expected that Sportradar will trade in the $10B - $12B range once it starts trading.  Genie should probs trade at a premium to Sportradar valuation given the enormous potential of its exclusive NFL deal over the coming years. Vauling Genie at a premium would imply a conservaitve estimate of $25 to $30 price per share based on the company’s CURRENT projections..

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f75x253ixbm71.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5a6d0efe77944fcd133102ba7e3424f6b93b026

Genie reported Q2 earnings on 9/8 which beat estimates.  Revenue was $55.8M and EBITDA $5.2M vs. street estimates of revenue $53.8M and EBITDA $1.7M.  Genie tightened its FY2022E guidance to $250M-$260M of revenue (which was increased in Q1 from $190M) and EBITDA of $10M-$20M.

Don’t take my word for i though, Wall Street analysts agree with their Price Targets:

* Benchmark BUY $33 PT
* Oppenheimer BUY $32 PT
* Goldman Sachs BUY $31 PT
* Craig Hallum BUY $30 PT
* Needham BUY $28 PT
* Singular Research BUY $28 PT

These 12-month price targets equate to an average $30.33 or 43 % upside from the current stock price.

Some other data points:

* Tute ownership 44.17%
* GENI is in a $330M net cash position 
* Does it pay a dividend? Of course not
* Free cash flow is absolutely atrocious - the company is in reinvest and GROWTH mode
* Holy fuck is price to sales looks steep based on 2020A at 27.9x, but gets cut in half by 2022E at 12.3x due to massive growth
* Positive seasonality outlook, very volatile but shows recently strong performance
* Sales forecast looks great, with a forecasted growth of 126% from 2020 to 2022
* First quarter group revenues of 52% year-over year
* First quarter group adj. EBITDA up 414% to 9.3M
* 6-year exclusive partnership with NFL
* Has exclusive events with almost every professional sports agency, as well as tournaments

# Part 2: Institutional fuckery

Spruce Point Capital Management [issued a hit piece](https://www.casino.org/news/genius-sports-stock-could-see-big-declines-says-noted-short-seller/) on Genie. Their primary claim is that Genius is a “middleman” with an “inferior business model” saying the stock could fall 60% to 80%, so a PT of $3.25 to $6.50. Well first off Spruce, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/uk0m1vhlxbm71.gif

With that being said, Spruce is clearly wrong. Given Spruce’s history of abject failure I would go further and say this report is baseless FUD. So, why would Spruce put itself in the path of a runaway train like Jenaay? Seems crazy tbh. Welp they’re known as a [“Smash &amp; Grab” short seller,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/reddit-jolts-activist-short-hedge-funds-into-adapt-or-die-mode) so these guys give friends an early view of their calls so they can front run the market before it's released to the public, profiting from the panic.  Spruce’s hit piece was released Aug 5th, the stock rose the entire day and it’s been in a legit uptrend since then, no panic lol. If this is Spruce’y bois M.O. they just fukd their company and their friends with another horrible call. [It seems like Sprucey’s gone into hiding, hoping this all blows over. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyjk9i/geni_spruce_point_smash_grab_shorts_disclose_your/)

Now it’s Cathie Wood’s turn to polish off Spruce’s beautiful thighs. Cathie started loading the boat Aug 5, the same day of Spruce’y bois FUD article, and the same day of the DKNG transformative day.

Can’t help but respect Cathie’s bullish buying. More importantly however, is this rising floor Cathie is building into the stock price. She is known for having strong convictions and sticking to them. She’ll buy a dip &amp; take the ride. 

[But don’t take my word for it. Check out this big, green, dildo. Cathie, you bad.](https://cathiesark.com/arkw/trends)

If you need any more proof, let’s take a look at the near-100%-of-float institution rate. It’s almost as if GENI has an unconscionably small float that’s being aggressively bought by diamond handz Cathie while the MM buys remaining float shares to hedge calls.

# Part 3: Float and Lizard 

Lizard theory has evolved since my [$NEGG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofojpw/whats_going_on_with_negg_a_ticker_with_35m_float/) and SPuRT posts. Other redditors have come up with extensions of the general idea. I’m going to do a breakdown of similar data from past analysis, including FTD rates and float comparisons, institutional ownership and recalculation of all this data (differs from online). 

As of now, the outstanding shares listed on Yahoo and sites such as [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/geni/statistics/) is 191.51M shares. \[However, the float varies, with Yahoo listing it as 63.36M and other sites listing it as 58.66M.\] 

**The current float can be calculated as follows:**  
SPAC IPO:    27.6M shares

Unlocked PIPE:   33M shares

Follow-On Offering:   22M shares

**Total tradable float:**   **82.6M shares**

**Lock up:**

Management (34.9M shares / 18% ownership) lockup expires on 11/17 and the SPAC Sponsor lockup (6.825M shares / 3.5% ownership) lockup expires on 10/17.  Apax, the private equity owner of Genius (60.2M shares / 30.9% ownership) lockup will expire on 10/17.  The gory details are all laid out here

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img i8iutvjtxbm71...*

They also list the institutional ownership as around 44-45% but doing some calculations shows this is higher. 

**So is this an overcount or undercount? Lets see.** 

**Begin Math:** 

Given **191.51M shares outstanding** as the general consensus across various financial sources, we can look into the overall preferred shares and institutional buyouts across several 13F filings and aggregated data on Fintel and StockAnalysis:

**Top 3 Institutional Holdings:**

1. Caledonia Investments - 16,305,582 shares
2. Fred Alger Management - 15,046,102 shares
3. Dmy Sponsor LLC - 6,825,000 shares

These top 3 holders combined have 38176684 shares or about 19.93% of the shares outstanding. 

There are 137 other funds that also own shares directly, for a total of 63694543 shares or about another 33.26% of the shares outstanding. 

Therefore, institutional ownership alone is around (19.93% + 33.26%) or 53.19% of shares outstanding. 

Next we can take a look at the insider transactions. This has a general consensus of 19.25%, indicating that a total of 72.44% of the outstanding shares are owned currently. 

Now lets take a look at merger deals, ETFs and ownership through mutual funds. 

We can see that the top holders for Q2 of 2021 in aggregate own 17,422,176 shares or about 9.10% of shares outstanding.  \[source fintel\]

**Our total ownership of outstanding shares becomes 81.54%.** 

However, now we need to account for any institutions holding shares through these funds and for this reason some ETFs are excluded. Fred Alger Management has 15,046,102 shares of GENI yet through the ATFV Alger’s ETF, they end up owning approximately… oh wait.. Lol… approximately an equivalent of 75 shares of GENI. Okay so looking at these ETFs looks like they have negligible impact on the float. 

**TLDR; The float for $GENI is about 35,352,746 shares or about 18.46% of outstanding shares.**  **With 4.14M** shares shorted this means that approximately **11.7% of the float is shorted.**

&amp;#x200B;

From the FTD angle we see that nice giant spike with the price staying stable/bleeding up. This type of pattern I’ve found to give more pop, and it’s something I looked for.

# Part 4: Flow

***Options Flow***

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img q9vahxuwxbm71...*

Order Sentiment: ***Bullish*** AF. 🌈🐻rekt. 77% of options activity over the last 30 days has been ***bullish.*** 66% of money invested has been placed on ***bullish*** bets of the stock rising.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bya2smuxxbm71.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e21f20b87f47c05a5df9c39ede3b8005e30a33b2

Call OI has been trending up over the last month, you can see an increase in OI for higher strikes as GENI’s share price has increased 34.43% over the last month. The smart money has been betting on the price increase continuing. 

The option chain: there are only monthly options, and the options chain itself is somewhat condensed to near the money strikes. This is all actually a good thing. It is forcing investors to streamline their investments into a more concentrated area, which has a greater overall impact on both hedging requirements and overall stock price. This is exactly how a MM or a shorty in duress would ***not*** want the options chain to look.

That said, it’s been under attack virtually sense day one by being shorted.

What it lacks is volume, and that’s what I hope this post generates.  Volume.  And then skies the limit.

Let’s face it, WKHS has been called a sham by some garbage scam artist and it’s taken a beating.  RIDE is under investigation by the SEC.

BBIG &amp; SPRT, despite die-hards still begging people to climb on-board all but seem to be fizzling.

Next play could be ARVL.

SHORT VOLUME 

It’s averaging a 51% short volume, with last Friday (September 3rd) at 59.43% alone (nakedshortreport.com).

For comparison, GME was at 58.65% on the 3rd.

SHORT SHARES AVAILABILITY 

On September 3rd, ARVL had 20,000 short shares available. (fintel).

For comparison, GME had 25,000 and BBIG was at 150,000 short shares available.

SHORT BORROW FEE RATES

ARVL is at 8.16% as of today.

For comparison, GME was at .64% as of Friday.  

Again, we all could do without the bashing;  I get there are a lot of bag older sfo other stocks all ousting their beloved tickers screaming “Squeeze Potential” in hopes it gathers steam so they can unload their shares.

But with momentum, volume, I believe ARVL is hitting on all cylinders for a serious up swing with enough Reddit backers.

And remember,  as the professionals have solicited, most squeezes last 4-6 days and average 40%-60% price increases.  Has BBIG &amp; SPRT run it’s course and could we catalyst ARVL as the next short squeeze target?

For those that don't know, this means that the stock moves opposite of the direction from the overall market.  So, if the overall market is going up, GME should be going down and vice versa.  Not only is this kind of thing **rare to see**, but the significance of it with GME fits the theory that the stock is outrageously short.

# So, why is this important? 

There is an expected taper to happen from the Federal Reserve soon.  Although specifics weren't mentioned, it has been rumored a 1-2% taper will happen which, should this happen, the markets will drop significantly.  If the taper is truly 1-2% without accounting for panic selling, the likely drop could be anywhere between 4-6% (overall).  This with the eventual contraction of monetary policy (which is much closer to us than we think) should cause the overall market to drop significantly as well.

Assuming things play out like this, GME's negative beta at -2.0 should mean it would increase at the rate the overall market drops and those short on GME will likely be squeezed out which, as a result, will force **massive levels of liquidation** on other securities to cover their short positions (naked as well) furthering negative movement for the overall market.

# GME's Beta vs Normal Stocks

Beta is a pretty accurate tool and for most stocks unafflicted by this form of manipulation, the relationship between the overall market's movement and the unafflicted stock's movement is crystal clear.  Not only is a negative beta rare to see, but **it's inconsistency with the overall market is equally rare too**.  In essence, it shows manipulation is happening because there are bouts where GME actually moves with the market despite having a negative beta.  I'm not talking about small dips or gains eithers, I'm talking about the overall picture, where we've seen SPY hit 450 and GME has been all over the place, yet, it's negative beta stands.

I don't have an immediate answer for this, but what we do know is that ETF's play a large role with those shorting meme stocks.  Same with options and thus, when we see GME move inconsistent with it's beta, what we're actually seeing is manipulation take place.  

TLDR

* GME has a negative beta which suggests that the stock moves opposite of the overall market.
* The Feds' taper and eventual contraction of monetary policy will cause the markets to drop significantly, which will likely the catalyst for shorts to be squeezed out.
* GME has a negative beta because of short positions taken on it.  Whenever shorts become squeezed out of their positions, massive levels of liquidation on other securities will happen to cover their short position which, as a result, should drop the overall market.
* The rate of GME's increase will likely be the rate of decrease for the overall market.
* GME's beta is not only extremely rare to see, but the extreme inconsistencies of it's movement is equally rare.  This alone shows that manipulation is taking place.

Below are two examples of when GME's beta reflects accurate movement.  However, again, compared to the overall picture (movement) of SPY, GME has been all over the place non-reflective of it's beta.

I'm sure it's not the first time you've come along Uranium, it appeared months ago and went with its success back to where it came from.

Everyone involved in GME, AMC and anything else on here knows there are 3 things you need:

1. A goal to act upon
2. A support from media
3. Big players outside of the general playingfield

GME and AMC have received all 3 heavily. Due to the shorting beyond any reasonable means they were prime targets. This alone was enough for a decent price movement, but media enabled a global coverage of the topic which made so many more people aware of whats going on and flocking in. And lastly, many big names joined in, let it be for testing the waters or to join the fight. I'm sure you have a full list in your mind right now.

**So what's with Uranium?**

Uranium is in a similar position and currently has the most aggressive movements in a company called **CCJ**, as well as ~~subreddit criteria~~. CCJ made it on the top 20 list of most bought options (in recent times) multiple times together with names of Tesla, Amazon etc.

I'll explain the reason refered to as point 1, but I'll keep it short as it's the least impact of all. Without 2) and 3) not a lot would happen.

So in short, Uranium mines pretty much tuned down mining over the years due to demand but also because they are in a bad position. Most uranium buyers will only purchase short to mid term what they need instead of making contracts. Since these buyers exist in smaller amounts but with huge impact they can control what happens with the price, pretty much. So production went along with this and decreased to a minimum that can barely cover the needs and even slight interruptions that go on for a while would cause major issues.

Now fast forward to the current date.

This is already 3) named Sprott.

If you don't know Sprott: ""Sprott is a global investment manager specializing in precious metals and real assets investing.""

What did they do? Well, don't take my word for it, let Bloomberg tell you what's going on:

&gt;Sprott has amassed **over 24 million pounds** of uranium, sometimes buying more than 500,000 pounds in a single day, according to its website and social media account. For comparison, total spot volume for 2020 was 92.2 million pounds, according to uranium investor Yellow Cake Plc.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/uranium-surges-to-six-year-high-as-fund-buys-up-physical-supply#:\~:text=Sprott%20has%20amassed%20over%2024,uranium%20investor%20Yellow%20Cake%20Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/uranium-surges-to-six-year-high-as-fund-buys-up-physical-supply#:~:text=Sprott%20has%20amassed%20over%2024,uranium%20investor%20Yellow%20Cake%20Plc).

The expectation here is not a short squeeze as of now. The main expectation is an insane surge in price due to the tight demand-supply that was floating around Uranium and is now majorly interrupted. With how tight it is Sprott can pretty much control the price to an extend and that's why it's going crazy.

**So what's with media support?**

[**https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-09-07/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html**](https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-09-07/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html)

Well, you are free to look for yourself, but it started and is as expected. The move of them is hyped up like crazy and this has by far not over at all. The initial price surge came from the news of them buying and announcing it, for a reference:

📷

SPROTT announces their purchase program of Uranium

The media coverage is there and it's just starting off. If you search for Uranium and go 1 month, 1 wekk and 1 day back on the Google search you'll see an exponential increase in articles despite the way less time a single day has compared to an entire week.

**But what's the future of Uranium?**

I can't tell you what happens, if that was the case I'd be rich, sitting on a bought island and slurping cocktails 24/7. But this move caused by a company, not by a random action or idea - so it's their own interest to make the most out of it and considering what they just caused they are most certainly no idiots. The first impact is the announcement and what people understand will follow: A lack of supply. So why shouldn't mines just produce more? They sold a ton to SPROTT and could now satisfy the lack of product, right? Well, not really. If they do this, SPROTT will most likely decline or stop buying more, meaning their bumped up production is completely wasted for a one time pay off that might not even be good for them. But wait, it gets worse - for the Uranium buyers. A ton of nuclear power stations are opening. Nuclear Power is pretty much green energy with a bad side effect of radioactivity, but that's why it was pushed more and more. It's by far better for the environment than coal, which countries move away from - at least if they care about the environment.

So combined: Miners will most likely not increase production because they would shoot into their own foot (their ultimate goal is longterm well paying contracts), demand for Uranium will surge up in the next months and years and SPROTT doesn't stop buying current production. No matter what happens the price will keep surging since SPROTT can pretty much set the price they want, but in a likely case this might spiral to levels that we had back in 2011 with 70-80$ or heck even 140$ in 2007. Mind you a big move away from Nuclear Power Plants happened a while ago and with the new found hype for Uranium and the given issues this could become bigger than ever before.

**So what do I do if I want to join?**

As mentioned you can either buy CCJ or the ~~subreddit criteria~~. All 3 are well performing among this surge. Don't get me wrong, all Uranium stocks have surged like crazy recently, but most options trading happens in CCJ while the ~~subreddit criteria~~ cover all the Uranium companies, making it a safer play though also covering the potential losers or low risers.

Everyone involved in GME, AMC and anything else on here knows there are 3 things you need:

1) A goal to act upon

2) A support from media

3) Big players outside of the general playingfield

GME and AMC have received all 3 heavily. Due to the shorting beyond any reasonable means they were prime targets. This alone was enough for a decent price movement, but media enabled a global coverage of the topic which made so many more people aware of whats going on and flocking in. And lastly, many big names joined in, let it be for testing the waters or to join the fight. I'm sure you have a full list in your mind right now.

**So what's with Uranium?**

Uranium is in a similar position and currently has the most aggressive movements in a company called **CCJ**, as well as the Uranium **ETF URA and URNM**. CCJ made it on the top 20 list of most bought options (in recent times) multiple times together with names of Tesla, Amazon etc.

I'll explain the reason refered to as point 1, but I'll keep it short as it's the least impact of all. Without 2) and 3) not a lot would happen.

So in short, Uranium mines pretty much tuned down mining over the years due to demand but also because they are in a bad position. Most uranium buyers will only purchase short to mid term what they need instead of making contracts. Since these buyers exist in smaller amounts but with huge impact they can control what happens with the price, pretty much. So production went along with this and decreased to a minimum that can barely cover the needs and even slight interruptions that go on for a while would cause major issues.

Now fast forward to the current date.

This is already 3) named Sprott. 

If you don't know Sprott: ""Sprott is a global investment manager specializing in precious metals and real assets investing.""

What did they do? Well, don't take my word for it, let Bloomberg tell you what's going on:

&gt;Sprott has amassed **over 24 million pounds** of uranium, sometimes buying more than 500,000 pounds in a single day, according to its website and social media account. For comparison, total spot volume for 2020 was 92.2 million pounds, according to uranium investor Yellow Cake Plc. 

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/uranium-surges-to-six-year-high-as-fund-buys-up-physical-supply#:\~:text=Sprott%20has%20amassed%20over%2024,uranium%20investor%20Yellow%20Cake%20Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/uranium-surges-to-six-year-high-as-fund-buys-up-physical-supply#:~:text=Sprott%20has%20amassed%20over%2024,uranium%20investor%20Yellow%20Cake%20Plc).

The expectation here is not a short squeeze as of now. The main expectation is an insane surge in price due to the tight demand-supply that was floating around Uranium and is now majorly interrupted. With how tight it is Sprott can pretty much control the price to an extend and that's why it's going crazy.

**So what's with media support?**

[**https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-09-07/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html**](https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-09-07/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html)

Well, you are free to look for yourself, but it started and is as expected. The move of them is hyped up like crazy and this has by far not started at all. The initial price surge came from the news of them buying and announcing it, for a reference:

[SPROTT announces their purchase program of Uranium](https://preview.redd.it/ijwwo9ejiam71.png?width=946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e33e76055355ccabc24481db96479c78d6e64d45)

The media coverage is there and it's just starting off. If you search for Uranium and go 1 month, 1 wekk and 1 day back on the Google search you'll see an exponential increase in articles despite the way less time a single day has compared to an entire week.

**But what's the future of Uranium?**

I can't tell you what happens, if that was the case I'd be rich, sitting on a bought island and slurping cocktails 24/7. But this move caused by a company, not by a random action or idea - so it's their own interest to make the most out of it and considering what they just caused they are most certainly no idiots. The first impact is the announcement and what people understand will follow: A lack of supply. So why shouldn't mines just produce more? They sold a ton to SPROTT and could now satisfy the lack of product, right? Well, not really. If they do this, SPROTT will most likely decline or stop buying more, meaning their bumped up production is completely wasted for a one time pay off that might not even be good for them. But wait, it gets worse - for the Uranium buyers. A ton of nuclear power stations are opening. Nuclear Power is pretty much green energy with a bad side effect of radioactivity, but that's why it was pushed more and more. It's by far better for the environment than coal, which countries move away from - at least if they care about the environment.

So combined: Miners will most likely not increase production because they would shoot into their own foot (their ultimate goal is longterm well paying contracts), demand for Uranium will surge up in the next months and years and SPROTT doesn't stop buying current production. No matter what happens the price will keep surging since SPROTT can pretty much set the price they want, but in a likely case this might spiral to levels that we had back in 2011 with 70-80$ or heck even 140$ in 2007. Mind you a big move away from Nuclear Power Plants happened a while ago and with the new found hype for Uranium and the given issues this could become bigger than ever before.

**So what do I do if I want to join?**

So I just noticed this new feature on etoro, they show you how many people are investing on something only when you share a post about opening a new position.

Etoro published that post when the voting thing was happening, where they stated that etoro's GME investors accounted for 1,5% of the total investors.

Thanks to my master in engineering I am able to do this calculation. \[Ironic\]

This means that with an average of 13 shares each, we're above the total outstanding shares.

1. CLOV: The number one most mentioned stock. I noticed over the weekend a lot of momentum started to build. Today the bias was confirmed.
2. AAPL: The blue chip stock that always gives back to investors. AAPL is indestructible with green day after green day.
3. TSLA: No description needed. In Elon we trust.
4. GME: GME has been lagging these short-squeeze stocks lately. Is it time this name takes off again? Earnings are coming up tomorrow after the close.
5. AMC: Still a top 5 squeeze stock and has been giving back to the ape community lately.

This deficit will only increase in future years, as additional reactors come online. If you want to quibble with my numbers, quibble away. I know I’m off by a few million pounds, but so is everyone else. No one really knows the true numbers—which is what makes commodity markets so fascinating in the first place. All that matters is that there is a deficit, it’s a big percentage of total production, new mines are not coming online at current prices and existing mines have had years of under-investment—hence production should continue to trail off without new investment.

How large are the above-ground stockpiles? No one knows. All we know is that they’re drawing down rapidly and outside of government entities, most of the stockpiles are spoken for by utilities, which are using their uranium to fabricate finished products for their reactors. However, a new class of investors has entered the market and they’ve completely upended the equilibrium.

Remember, GBTC?? I remember it quite fondly. What if I told you there’s another entity doing the same thing in uranium, but it is cornering the free float at a rate that makes the boys at GBTC look like amateurs? What if the free float is organically shrinking due to the supply deficit? What will happen as institutional investors jam themselves into a far smaller market? Fukit, who cares? Someone intends to conduct this science experiment; consequences be damned. Importantly, this entity is using an At The Market offering (ATM). Hence, it immediately produces free trading shares; increasing trading volume far more rapidly than GBTC with its 6-month hold—making acquisition by institutional investors possible and driving adoption. Basically, it’s GBTC 2.0—issue shares to buy product. Every day. Relentlessly. Except, against a smaller and shrinking asset class.

Uranium is different—almost everyone who owns uranium today, owns it because they intend to consume it in their reactors—these owners are all incremental buyers going forward. In a market with a deficit, they’re all implicitly short uranium. With an entity buying up the free float, they’re going to get squeezed. We all know how squeezes work, but I don’t know of any similar scenario where the squeeze was as aggressive or blatant. The utilities are blissfully unaware, they’re eventually going to panic and pay any price for uranium as a reactor that runs out of uranium is just an expensive paperweight.

Sprott Physical Uranium Trust commonly known as SPUT (SRUUF– Canada), is the entity that has upended the uranium market. **Since launching its ATM 13 days ago, it has acquired 2.7 million pounds of uranium**. This is an average daily rate in excess of 200,000 pounds or roughly a third of global production on an annual basis**. If GBTC is the roadmap to follow, as the price of uranium begins to appreciate, the inflows into the trust should accelerate. Interestingly, there are plenty of other entities also purchasing physical uranium, uranium that utilities were counting on for their future needs. The squeeze is on.**

As expected, the utilities are blissfully unaware. Surprised?? I’m not. Utilities are quasi-governmental agencies, managed by the types of fukwits who’d work at your local DMV, except they enjoy stock options. The fact that they’ve ignored the coming squeeze shouldn’t be surprising. Inevitably, they’ll demand rate increases to buy back this uranium–it’s not their money anyway. This is your bid at some point in the future.

Commodities are determined by supply and demand. Uranium is a small market at roughly $6.3 billion in annual consumption (180 million pounds at $35/lb). SPUT has raised approximately $85 million in the 13 days since the ATM went live. It’s hoovering up supply and is already struggling to procure pounds, as shown by their increasing cash balance—cash that they’re legally forced to spend. 

**Something is going to give here, and I suspect it’s the price of uranium.**

In any case, when I saw the rate at which SPUT was issuing shares, I legged into a rather large pile of SPUT. I’m also long a few producers along with some juniors for extra kick. (Please don’t ask me which—if I wanted to name them, I would have). Uranium just broke out to 5-year highs. New highs bring in publicity, which often brings in new buyers and the cycle repeats. I like buying new highs from a big base—especially with SPUT out there playing Pac-Man. I pulled back my exposure all summer as I was awaiting something interesting. I don’t think I’ll see anything better than uranium for a while. Let’s just say that I’m suddenly back to being VERY fully invested.

I need to write a bit more because apparently my submission is not long enough to make sense for a post. Honestly I think it does, but I know where the mod are coming from, is understandable.

At this point I think it should be enough? Who knows.. I can keep going like when your wife is trying to say some shit about her day and about what she have been doing. We all know that we don't care about that shit, also because she grabs our attention for like 1 hour while she could've said the same damn thing in just like  1 minute? Most of the words are useless because they don't add any value at the discussion, but still required because the wife decide that she has a lot to say.

Every now and then she'll be ""are you listening"" and you need to look at her instead of the GME graph going to the moon, because if you don't... Then you sleep in the couch.

That's the reason why she has a bf, I guess our wife bf listen her... Or he pretend to. But because he does it so well, she give him better rewards that you never got before (that backdoor that you've been asking for years, he got it in just few days by listening to her shit).

This should be enough to tell you that you've to read/listen it carefully till the very end before you say something about it.

I know I said I was done updating on $IRNT, but I checked OI, and I couldn't help writing another update. Because we've got a 3 day weekend, I think we got the updated OI numbers a bit earlier than normal. I'll just paste them below to get started, then throw out some observations. Again, data from here: [https://www.cboe.com/delayed\_quotes/irnt/quote\_table](https://www.cboe.com/delayed_quotes/irnt/quote_table). This is September expiries only. The only other expiration date with decent OI is October, and it's a fraction of September and doesn't change the analysis meaningfully.

https://preview.redd.it/6q5ik9mg63m71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c33e51a5b4e559c1710eb493c4904f1b4b7a0d7f

I think it's obvious looking at that table why the price went parabolic after hours. This was as of close on Friday, and 79% of the float was spoken for by delta-hedging options.

* Total call open interest went from 37k to 44k. The biggest changes were the newly listed strikes at $14 and $16 with an increase of 2k each.
* While those strikes tied up another 500k in shares, the other big change was the increase in delta at the $17.5 and $20 strikes which which doubled the shares represented from 400k to 800k.
* Put OI increased by approximately 2k, but the dramatic price increase sent delta towards 0 and effectively reduced the shares represented by 25%.
* The market opened up $31 through $37 strikes for trading tomorrow.

What does that all mean for tomorrow? Honest answer: I'm not sure and you shouldn't base any decisions on my speculation below. I'm playing with house money and trying to turn a 10x into a 100x here. However, what I think it means:

* This is actually, dare I say it, a $GME situation but on a far smaller scale... There just aren't enough shares, and it's going to be a technically driven frenzy. It could all happen tomorrow, or it could be a multi-day leg up like we saw in prior gamma squeezes.
* The delta adjusted OI has already wrapped up almost the entire float, and if the afterhours settled price of \~$30 holds, delta for the $20s will jump to \~.8 and the increase in demand for shares for \*only\* that strike will be another 700k shares that are not currently available.
* I don't know where this could stop, but I'm hoping I can exit my calls at a share price of &gt;$80.

So what are the risks? What could derail this money machine? I see a few key risks in order of likelihood:

* IV for calls blows up over 300-400, creating lots of sellers looking for a quick flip. This would have been me last week, but with the latest update, I'm holding out for more than 2x from Friday.
* The MM hedge by buying an enormous volume of September puts at the top of the option chain. As put IV blows up, selling them will become more attractive to our friends over at thetagang, and MM will be buying delta from them to offset the runaway train on the call side.
* MMs could hedge by buying calls in the out months to offset the short dated calls. That would leave them exposed to theta and lots of the lesser Greeks guys like us don't worry about, but that might be the lesser of two evils in this case. I believe that reduces their need for total shares since the long and short calls would offset each other, for the most part.
* Some sort of action by an exchange or individual brokers to reduce volatility. This could be as simple as lots of market stops that interrupt momentum, or something more insidious like blowing up collateral requirements (although they're already 100% on Schwab) or limiting buys. I think this is unlikely because there aren't enough shares for this to make up a meaningful % of client assets like $GME and $AMC were.
* Company action to increase float immediately. I think this is the least likely because any change would likely require a vote, a multiple day notification to shareholders, and/or a board of directors meeting. Only the board meeting can happen quickly. I'm not sure if there could be an announcement to direct list some of the lockup shares at board discretion. Any securities lawyers here who would know? That would be by far the most likely to stop this in its tracks, but I don't think they can do that. If I'm wrong, please let me know!

Last thing I want to say. There WILL be an announcement of the listing of the PIPE soon. It could come as soon as tomorrow or as late as 30 days after ticker change. That will almost certainly not have immediate effect, so there is no reason to dump your shares the minute that filing comes out. There will likely be a temporary pullback when they announce listing of the PIPE shares, but I think it will be an overreaction because the share count will not be immediately changed. This should stay crazy through the 17th, and if call buying rolls through October could continue after that as well.

My position here remains small: 20 $20 September calls. I may add some shares depending how the premarket goes tomorrow.

Really ruffled my jimmies and I'm sick to death about hearing ""meme stocks"" from every corner.  


Wtf is a meme stock? IT DOESNT EXIST. Is GME a meme stock?  Is the current situation with GME and AMC really just a bunch of us decided to prop something up that has no value? (The media's take). NO. FUCK NO. These cocksucker hedgefunds have been illegally/legally blowing up the companies we grew up with for profit and market monopolization and WE CAUGHT THEM. ITS NOT A FUCKING MEME. ITS THE FALL OF OF THE FUCKING ECONOMY.  


Now everyone can jump on the bandwagon and just cannibalize WSB meta deta in an attempt to sell people bullshit. Grade A pure George Carlin referenced bullshit.

Fuck off.  


I'm into GME because these companies got caught with their pants down and now they owe me millions. I'm on WSB for lossporn and bold yolos.   


I still can't figure out what a fucking MEME stock is. I keep being told what it is. But fuck you that's not reality. That's not what this place is. That's not what this place has ever been about.

# **Markets brace for hot consumer inflation report in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/markets-brace-for-hot-consumer-inflation-report-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors are paying close attention to any reading on inflation these days, and the consumer price index will be the big one to watch in the coming week.
*****
&gt; The latest snapshot of the economy comes just a week before the Federal Reserve’s important September meeting. At that meeting, the Fed is expected to discuss more details about its plan to taper down its bond buying program, or quantitative easing.
*****
&gt; Market professionals say a hotter inflation reading could speed up the Fed’s plans to slow the $120 billion a month in bond purchases. The paring back of its asset purchase program would be the Fed’s first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to combat the pandemic.
*****
&gt; The consumer price index is expected Tuesday, and there is retail sales data is released Thursday. They are expected to show consumer prices jumped at a 5.3% annual pace in August, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet, while the consumer continued to pull back from the high spending levels of earlier in the year.
*****
&gt; # Hot CPI
&gt; “If the CPI is hotter than expected, it could make the difference between a September announcement for tapering or waiting to November,” Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.
*****
&gt; Economists expect CPI to rise at a 0.4% pace month over month. The report comes after August’s producer price index — which was released Friday — showed a jump of 8.3% year over year, due in part to supply chain constraints.
*****
https://i.imgur.com/3ia6fMl.png
*****
&gt; The Fed’s formal announcement about tapering its bond-buying program, also called QE, is widely expected in November or December. Many of those who had expected a September announcement pushed back their time frame to later in the year after August’s employment report showed just 235,000 jobs added, about 500,000 less than expected.
*****
&gt; “Certainly the trend has been for the inflation number to come in above expectations. I think if that happens again, it will feed the narrative that high inflation is going to stick. Obviously, it’s an issue for the bond market if it’s viewed at all as accelerating the timing of the QE tapering, and or accelerating the timing of the first rate hike,” CIBC Private Wealth U.S. chief investment officer David Donabedian said. That would be a negative for stocks.
*****
&gt; “If markets have an inflation mutiny here and there’s volatility as a result, they could move it up to September,” Donabedian said of the Fed’s taper announcement. “But I think there’s kind of a one in four likelihood in my view.”
*****
&gt; # Stagflation?
&gt; That combination of higher inflation and slower spending, particularly after August’s weaker jobs report, has spurred talk about the threat of stagflation. Those worries have also increased as economists ratchet back growth forecasts for the third quarter to a still high level just above 5%, from above 6%.
*****
&gt; “I’m more about the ‘flation’ side of it than the ‘stag.’ I think the economy is going to perform fine right through next year,” Donabedian said. He said the slowdown in consumer spending after stimulus checks had boosted retail sales earlier in the year is not surprising and may be just a “short-term warning.”
*****
&gt; “We had this explosive growth in retail sales early in the year as a direct result of stimulus payments and vaccines coming and a burst of consumer optimism. It’s really settled down now,” he said. “There was an enormous amount of liquidity and saving and they spent what they spent out of that extra amount of savings and you’re going through a bit of a retracement here, which is why you’re seeing economists mark down their third quarter estimates. Consumer fundamentals are pretty good.”
*****
&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said he expects the CPI report to show that inflation is peaking, just as the Fed has said. But he says the slowing trend is not just an issue for consumer spending. It is also showing up in business spending and housing.
*****
&gt; “With where labor markets are, August was a bit of an egg. But growth in employment has been solid on average, very robust over the course of the year,” he said. “Even though employment disappointed in August, hours and and earnings were still pretty good. There’s income there for consumers to spend. We’re looking at this as a short-term hiccup.”
*****
&gt; Gapen said third-quarter economic growth may be somewhat slower than expected. However, he said some of the lost growth could show up in the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; “It has some characteristics of stagflation, but true stagflation is rising unemployment and rising inflation. We don’t have that,” he said. “These are bottlenecks that are kind of constraining the pace of the recovery and lead to higher inflation. Demand isn’t the problem right now. Supply is. The unemployment rate is still coming down and employment is improving. It has the whiff but I wouldn’t call it stagflation.”
*****

*****
&gt; Donabedian expects higher prices and shortages to continue into next year, as supply chains keep getting disrupted. Some companies, including PPG and General Electric, have already commented on how they see issues with supplies stretching into 2022. Donabedian expects to see more warnings ahead of the third-quarter earnings season.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lower this week, with the S&amp;P 500 losing 1.7% to 4,458. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held above 1.3% and was at 1.33% on Friday.
*****
&gt; A number of strategists expect to see the stock market pullback during the typically choppy September and October period. Some say the Fed’s September meeting could be a catalyst, especially if the central bank sounds particularly hawkish.
*****
https://i.imgur.com/IP5Vq9T.png
*****
&gt; “We’re up over 30% in 2019, over 18% last year and over 21% in the first months of this year,” Donabedian said. “These are unsustainable rates or return. ...Our takeaway is it’s going to get tougher from here. Valuations are somewhat extended and this whole incredibly supportive policy framework is going to get a little less friendly.”
*****
&gt; # Now watch Congress
&gt; Donabedian said it will be important to watch discussions in Congress as it begins to put details around the infrastructure spending and what type of tax increases will be proposed to pay for it.
*****
&gt; “They’re going to start to fill in the blanks on where the money is going to be spent and what taxes and tax rates are going to be written into the legislation,” he said. “It’s the overall corporate tax rate, it’s the tax on foreign earned income, capital gains rates and dividend tax rate. These are big investor related issues.”
*****
&gt; He said the market has been ignoring the tax issue. “Those sort of issues went quiet over the summer but it’s back full bore over the next two weeks. It will get a lot of attention.”
*****
&gt; The tax decisions could have big implications for corporate earnings, which have been a big driver of the stock market’s gains. “One very direct way that could go wrong is if you get a large set of tax increases that go into effect in 2022. That’s a direct hair cut,” he said.

&gt; # Beige Book Decelerates As Delta Impact Widens

&gt; Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve updated its twice-quarterly qualitative assessment of the economy based on conversations with business contacts across the twelve regional districts. For each Beige Book release, we apply a natural language processing algorithm to assess the relative frequency of positive versus negative words, giving us a quantitative comparison of Beige Books over time. As shown in the chart below, our index of Beige Book activity has fallen from record levels recorded back in June to elevated but much more modest levels in September. That's consistent with the Fed's description of ""moderate"" growth thanks to the impact of the Delta variant.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091021-Beige.png))**

&gt; In the second chart below, we show the relationship between GDP growth and our Beige Book Index from above. As shown, the current reading of our index equates to GDP growth of a bit less than 4% YoY. But keep in mind that extreme base effects are still driving wild YoY GDP readings. With that in mind, the Beige Book Index appears to be showing above-trend but decelerating growth, when accounting for base effects of the extremely low GDP reading from Q2 of 2020.

&gt; # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks

&gt; Over the course of 2021, we have seen some aggressive short squeezes, resulting in turmoil for certain financial institutions and millions in profits for some retail traders. The ""reddit army"" has gone after multiple stocks, most notably Game Stop (GME) and AMC (AMC). Let's dive into the 25 companies in the Russell 3,000 currently with the highest short interest as a percentage of float. Of these 25 companies, only 8 have experienced positive returns in 2021, and 6 have seen their share price half. Since GameStop peaked in late January, 20 of the companies on this list have lost value, and 9 have seen their equity trade down by 50%. Since AMC's peak in early June, 7 companies have seen price appreciation, and zero have seen their value decrease by 50%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Russell-3000-Highest-SIPF.png))**

&gt; The average short interest as a percentage of float for the entirety of the Russell 3,000 is 3.46%, but certain sectors have much higher proportional short interest than others. Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Real Estate have the highest, while Utilities, Financials, and Consumer Staples have the lowest. High levels of short interest is a sign of negative investor sentiment, but certain sectors will consistently have higher figures due to the riskiness of their business models.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/R3000-Sector-Short-interest.png))**

&gt; To dive deeper, let's look at the average short interest in each industry. Retail, Pharma &amp; Biotech, and Consumer Services have the highest levels, while Banks, Tech Hardware, and Utilities have the lowest levels. The average short interest in the retailing industry is more than three times higher than that of banks for companies in the Russell 3,000.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Industry-avg-SIPF-Russell-3000.png))**

&gt; Although there are many exceptions to the rule, in 2021 equities with higher short interest have generally underperformed the remainder of the Russell 3,000. The average return for equities with short interest between zero and ten percent were higher than that of equities with 33%+ short interest.

&gt; To support this, let's undergo a decile analysis. The stocks in the top 20% in terms of short interest have significantly underperformed the rest of the Russell 3,000 since GME hit its highs. While the equities in the bottom 20% of short interest have averaged a 22.23% return since January 27th (GameStop's top), the top 20% of most heavily shorted stocks have declined by 1.40% on average.

&gt; # Largest 25 Stocks in the S&amp;P 500, Now vs 20 Years Ago

&gt; Yesterday, we took a look at the makeup of the S&amp;P 500's largest 25 companies in 2021 and compared it to that of 10 years ago. Today, we will be extending the study to 2001, twenty years ago right before the 9/11 attacks. On the day before 9/11, the sectors with the largest number of components in the top 25 in terms of market cap were Consumer Staples, Health Care, Technology, Financials, and Communication Services. While all of these sectors still hold a spot in the current top 25 list, the makeup has shifted substantially. Energy and Industrials, which each accounted for 8% of the top 25 companies in 2001, now have zero representation in today's list. Consumer Staples also reduced its count from five to two.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/sector-breakdown-top-25-stocks-now-vs-2001-v2.png))**

&gt; Only four companies that made up the list of top 25 names in September 2001 remain on the list today. Those four companies are Microsoft (MSFT), J&amp;J (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Pfizer (PFE). The average return of these four equities, excluding dividends, is 221.81% with a median of 129.58%. While the turnover of this list has been high over the last 20 years, every member of this list is still in operation today, but two have been undergone mergers (Time Warner &amp; Royal Dutch Petroleum). Interestingly enough, the members of this list have approximately the same proportionate makeup of the S&amp;P 500, with only a 1.89% increase in the weightings of the top 25 stocks now relative to September 2001.

&gt; The US economy today is far different than it was in 2001. As it has changed, some companies have adapted and experienced massive growth, while others have been left in the dust. Apart from the two companies that are no longer independently publicly traded, the average return of the 25 largest companies from 2001 is 92.94% with a median return of 49.08%. Over that same period, the S&amp;P 500 has returned 310.61%.

&gt; # September Seasonal Pattern: Weakness After Mid-Month

&gt; September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However after mid-month, any gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by month’s end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.

&gt; # September quarterly option expiration week: S&amp;P 500 up 13 of last 18

&gt; September’s option expiration week is up 59.0% of the time for S&amp;P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 53.8% of the time and 56.4% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last eighteen years, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September’s option expiration week, up thirteen times. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&amp;P 500 has been down eight of the last nine since.

&gt; # What Could Happen The Rest of the Year to Stocks and Bonds?

&gt; This week in the latest LPL Market Signals podcast, Ryan Detrick and Lawrence Gillum discussed global central bank policy, recently weakening economic data, and where stocks and bonds could go the remainder of this year.

&gt; In today’s blog we will focus on their discussion on stocks and bonds.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index was up more than 20% by the end of August for the first time since 1997 and it has made a new high every single month this year so far (9 for 9). Incredibly, it made 53 new highs before August was over, the most ever. Any way you slice it, this year is historic for the bulls.

&gt; The catch (and there’s always a catch) is the S&amp;P 500 hasn’t pulled back 5% all year, with the last 5% pullback last October. Not to mention September is the worst month for stocks the past 10 years, 20 years, and since 1950.

&gt; But history says that great starts to a year tend to see continued strength the final four months. “Looking at the previous top 10 starts to a year ever, the final four months have gained eight times,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “So should we see any seasonal weakness, we’d use it as an opportunity to buy before likely continued strength.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 2021 ranks as the 6th best start to a year ever. The previous top 10 best starts to a year averaged a return of 4.0% the rest of the year, with a very solid median return 5.4%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.8.21-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Turning to bonds, we continue to expect higher yields due to the growth and inflation outlook, with a target of 1.75% on the 10-year treasury yield by year end. This of course could pressure bonds, as they trade inversely with yields.

&gt; From a portfolio point of view, we would keep overall interest rate sensitivity muted and favor mortgage-backed securities and short- to intermediate-maturity investment grade corporates. As a result of our higher rates call, we suggest being underweight longer maturity high grade corporates or long-term treasuries, which are more sensitive to rising rates. So sum it up, taking a more of a defensive posture as it relates to interest rate sensitivity makes a lot of sense the remainder of 2021.

&gt; Also, the potential this week for a European Central Bank (ECB) announcement on tapering could push European yields higher, which in turn could push U.S. yields higher as well.

GME and AMC, we all know what that this play is about, no need for a deep dive on this one. At this point, if that play was bullshit it would have crashed by now. For anyone still skeptical about this … well.

Uranium squeeze is not bullshit. From what I’ve read about Uranium spot market (thanks to some delightful in-depth DD and my own not-in-depth research), this is very much a big play from what I’m seeing.

BB, NOK, &amp; CLOV are growth stocks. NOK should be making good profits and taking over market share until at least 2026.

BB &amp; CLOV can become market disruptor if all goes well.

I have a few other valid plays I’m monitoring and if I see something worth writing about I’ll post it.

Full discretion: I’m not holding any of these stocks, but I’m planning on starting another account and building some other type of unorthodox portfolio. When I do, I’ll be starting with the purchases of GME and trickle down from there.

Today's top mentions include the #1 take-over by Apple that occurred over the last 30 minutes. Here they are:

&amp;#x200B;

* AAPL: Apple became the #1 stock mentioned on WSB at exactly 11:20am. What happened? The share price went from +0.50% to -3% in a matter of minutes. It's actually amazing how fast WSB is to take note of any action in the market. The correlating AAPL chart is below so you can see the change of mentions on the first chart vs the stock price.
* CLOV: This stock seems to have taken the #1 squeeze name on WSB. My theory is that AMC and GME are old news and now CLOV, which is seemingly under-valued from reaching almost $30 just a couple months ago, has the potential to fly again.
* CCJ: A new name on the list and kind of unusual for WSB (uranium play??). WSB knows the power of uranium since a lot of members are probably buying uranium ore and storing it under their pillow versus just buying the stock.
* AMC: AMC nothing new here.
* TSLA: Elon tweets are keeping this stock alive as traders patiently wait for the next gamma squeeze.

2 days ago, Wednesday the 8th, was the day before of my last uni exam.

While i was studying as a little bastard, swallowed by my paranoia, i had the brilliant idea to enter in a trade…

I saw GME earning as an opportunity to make dollars… But i said to myself: “You don’t know nothing about finance, don’t bet just on 1 side!” (This was a good point btw)

I have decided to play a straddle @ 195, having a look to option profit calculator to know the probability of success.

I saw a little loss zone between 194$ and 199$ and i was scary to the possible scenario where the price would stay stiff as Rocco Siffredi’s bird 🐦.

As the man who reinvent the wheel i have decided to sell a @ 250 call, receiving premium and be covered on that loss zone just trading off some eventual profit.

All this business for the cost of 3013$ (I know you’re thinking “some pennies”, but that’s not little money for a little Italian stallion).

All right at this point i was standing in front of this chart with green square all over the website, and i said to myself: ""What could go wrong? Nothing isn't it?""

I was like “OMG you’re killing the finance industry with your pennies, you finally found the glitch to stamp money!!!”.

At this point you have to know that i’m really in finance world, i’m studying, learning as many info as i can using whatever way possible, all right??

I finally find the courage to enter in the trade at 8:17 pm CEST, around 1 hour later it was up by 200$ (that’s not bad money for me).

Now was the moment to take the decision, be happy with this 200$ in 1 hour or play the day after… In the most important stadium of the country, as you’re in the finals and Lebron is passing you the ball for the buzzer beater!

The greedy kicks in! You want to be the protagonist of this movie! You want to be the man who brings home the ring!!! 💍

Hour 3:28 pm CEST

I’m in my car driving, i swap the seat with my (after this) ex-girlfriend, ready to collect as many money as i can, foaming at the mouths, with my eyes falling out!!

I opened IB app, and it was up by 400$.

I was polishing my scepter as shiny as i could, i was ready to take my juicy profit.

&amp;#x200B;

Hour 3:30:02 pm CEST

Market open, time to refresh the app, and then…

IV FU\*\*ED ME AS HARD AS SHE COULD, AND THE BEST THING IS THAN I SETTED UP MYSELF AT 90° (perfect water temperature for boil your pasta) BUT NOT FOR TAKE AN HYPERLOOP IN YOUR A. HOLE.

Long story short: Never believe you can beat the market easy, and take a look at IV before enter in a trade, she could be stiff as Rocco’s Bird!!!

2 days ago, Wednesday the 8th, was the day before of my last uni exam.

While i was studying as a little bastard, swallowed by my paranoia, i had the brilliant idea to enter in a trade…

I saw GME earning as an opportunity to make dollars… But i said to myself: “You don’t know nothing about finance, don’t bet just on 1 side!” (This was a good point btw)

I have decided to play a straddle @ 195, having a look to option profit calculator to know the probability of success.

I saw a little loss zone between 194$ and 199$ and i was scary to the possible scenario where the price would stay stiff as Rocco Siffredi’s bird 🐦.

As the man who reinvent the wheel i have decided to sell a @ 250 call, receiving premium and be covered on that loss zone just trading off some eventual profit.

All this business for the cost of 3013$ (I know you’re thinking “some pennies”, but that’s not little money for a little Italian stallion).

All right at this point i was standing in front of this chart…

&amp;#x200B;

I was like “OMG you’re killing the finance industry with your pennies, you finally found the glitch to stamp money!!!”.

At this point you have to know that i’m really in finance world, i’m studying, learning as many info as i can using whatever way possible, all right??

I finally find the courage to enter in the trade at 8:17 pm CEST, around 1 hour later it was up by 200$ (that’s not bad money for me).

Now was the moment to take the decision, be happy with this 200$ in 1 hour or play the day after… In the most important stadium of the country, as you’re in the finals and Lebron is passing you the ball for the buzzer beater!

The greedy kicks in! You want to be the protagonist of this movie! You want to be the man who brings home the ring!!! 💍

Hour 3:28 pm CEST

I’m in my car driving, i swap the seat with my (after this) ex-girlfriend, ready to collect as many money as i can, foaming at the mouths, with my eyes falling out!!

I opened IB app, and it was up by 400$.

I was wanking myself as hard as i could, i was ready to take my juicy profit.

&amp;#x200B;

Hour 3:30:02 pm CEST

Market open, time to refresh the app, and then… 

&amp;#x200B;

IV FUCKED ME AS HARD AS SHE COULD, AND THE BEST THING IS THAN I SETTED UP MYSELF AT 90° (perfect water temperature for boil your pasta) BUT NOT FOR TAKE AN HYPERLOOP IN YOUR ASS.

Long story short: Never believe you can beat the market easy, and take a look at IV before enter in a trade, she could be stiff as Rocco’s Bird!!!

Now is the time to buy and put the pressure on the shorts. Shrinking liquidity(low volume) with added buying pressure can push this over the edge. The shorts are looking at over 1.3 million shares alone on call options expiring next week between a $7.50-$10 strike price. Thats damn near 10% of the float alone.

Liquidity is drying up and volume was 1.18 million today. The lowest its been since this was under $2. With a heavy rush of buyers on this micro float (14 million) we can raise the price easily.

This would cause a gama squeeze and force the shorts to buy up almost 10% of the float by next Friday.

This was shorted at over 200% at one time just like GME. It wasnt until the options chain was introduced that the SI went down. You guys know the game...

Im guessing they owe over 20 million shares (on a 14 million float) on a conservative estimate.

Over 9 million FTDs from july alone are due. That doesnt count the current SI which is 20% and another 2.5 million shares. Or the 15% of the float on loan which is another nearly 2 million shares.

Im not even including the original 200% SI in these figures.

Shrinking liquidity(low volume) with added buying pressure can push this over the edge.  The shorts are looking at over 1.3 million shares alone on call options expiring next week between a $7.50-$10 strike price. Thats damn near 10% of the float alone.    
 

Liquidity is drying up and volume was 1.18 million today. The lowest its been since this was under $2. With a heavy rush of buyers on this micro float (14 million) we can raise the price easily.

&amp;#x200B;

This would cause a gama squeeze and force the shorts to buy up almost 10% of the float by next Friday. 

This was shorted at over 200% at one time just like GME. It wasnt until the options chain was introduced that the SI went down. You guys know the game...

&amp;#x200B;

Im guessing they owe over 20 million shares  (on a 14 million float) on a conservative estimate.

&amp;#x200B;

Over 9 million FTDs from july alone are due. That doesnt count the current SI which is 20%  and another 2.5 million shares. Or the 15% of the float on loan which is another nearly 2 million shares.

I think everyone would agree that the insiders like money. Obviously, they are going to do everything they can to maintain a floor of $20 so they get their bonuses.

until now I was a silent reader and just commented a bit here and there. I learned a lot about stocks, short selling an the stock marked in general. Thank you for that.

I was trying to find a good investment and stumbled across several websites listing stocks by their short interest, etc.

So I found EVI industries, Inc. ($EVI). They have a float of 4.46M Shares, but 62.12 % are held by insiders and 36.42% are held by instituation, which leaves just 1.46 % left for common apes like us. 726.12K shares are short, and the general average vol. is just 15-21k. So short ratio is 50.7!! This means they need 50 days to cover their positions, wich is insane. Short ratio of GME is 2.76 right now. 

Actually the fundamentals aren't great. But isnt this the perfect play anyaways? I mean, if just 10 % of us WSB apes would by 10 shares, we would not only own the complete float but all shares outstanding and shorts will never be able to cover.

What am I missing about this, that no one talks about this stock?

# Synopsis:

I usually think of getting into a position based on where I think the company can disrupt inside of current culture. Now I don't know about you, but in today's world of free porn, the ability to swipe on hundreds of potential matches (bumble/tinder) has put a lot of pressure on guys/girls to look and feel their best. But who wants to walk into a doctors office and tell the 75 year old man that he is having a hard time getting it up? Or that his hair is going away? Or that she wants to clear those dots off her skin. It's 2021. Can't we text you?

***$HIMS takes away the pressure of going to a doctor to try and explain why you want some blue bombers. If you could save yourself the embarrassment of telling another soul that you want to rock your girl's world without saying it face to face - wouldn't you?***  


# Technicals (here comes the crayons):

Also, it's trading underneath it's IPO price... in a growing field... that will... only get bigger..... If you don't like that chart, just flip it upside down.

***From some random twitters that I get my bias from:***  
$HIMS likely to be on a run-rate of more than $300 million by Q4 2021, to just be burning through $15 million per quarter isn't much at all, considering the amount of investment that's required to grow consumer awareness of its brand. Management holds nearly 40% of the stock.  Stock is near all time lows. 

$HIMS originally guided for 2021 revenue of $179 million *before* going public. Now guiding for $255 in 2021, ahead of the 2022 revenue projections.

# The Sector:

Telemedicine has exploded since the COVID plandemic has hit. People are realizing not only do you not have to work from home, but you can get most of your basic health needs done from the tap of a few buttons rather than in a waiting room. Sure, if you have a rash on your junk, you should probably see a doctor. But hey, if you want to kick it up a notch with the ladies... Hydrate your skin or just consider getting some more of your hair back.. Why would you walk into an office? This sector is growing at such a rapid pace, it's going to become more normal than a specialty. Kind of like.. you know calling someone versus texting someone.  


# The looks of the company:

If you look at the marketing and branding, they feel young and fresh. Partnering with people like Gronk (Bucs player) / Miley Cyrus (singer) and the look/appeal of the website reminds me a lot of what brought a lot of success to companies like Lululemon, or hell even Apple if you want to go that far. Keep it clean, keep it simple. They are focused on a target that uses phones as part of their daily ritual. A target that uses TikTok/IG for advice versus listening to the boomers at the dinner table.  


# End thoughts:

While I don't know if the stock will ultimately go up, i do believe at this price... the risk is well worth the reward. It won't rocket like $GME/$AMC on some meme dream, but if you hold it for a while we could see a similar pattern to what happened with $TDOC. I have no gay bear thesis here, because we all know stonks only go up.

GME made me more money than I've ever had, so I hope this can do something like that for some of yall, truly. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Quick Pitch

ASO is at a P/E ratio of 6.6 -7, with revenue $6+ billion, increasing margins and more profitable than ever, amarket cap of only $3.5b and their debt load being dramatically reduced ahead of schedule. Heavily owned by institutions, KKR dramatically reducing their majority shareholder % to now only 20%. A share repurchase program for $500mil and a lot of insider buying and Ken Hicks who turned Footlocker around took their share price straight up…. How and why are people you guys not buying this up? This 6% dip this morning is probably the best value you can get on the market. Its pretty much an anomaly in today’s market climate. 

DKS (Dicks sporting goods) PE ratio is at a 11/12. If ASO was adjusted to just a PE of 9 they would be somewhere around $58.00 a share which is a 45% increase from where we are at today. 9 is extremely fair. As the best and most efficient retailor in the market they should be a 15 or $85 a share. 

ASO, Academy Sports and Outdoors, is massively undervalued compared to its peers and it is the best player in the space. Why aren’t retail investors piling into this for locked  gains has me confused? It’s a real company with real customers that are loyal and lifers of Academy, many have been shopping there since they were kids and now it’s where they shop for their kids.  My guess is investors see Covid days as good as it’s going to get for Academy, but the reopening is proving to be even bigger and permanent than expected.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It’s important to know where Academy stores are located and who they serve. Academy has 259 mostly in the Southeast. They are a low/mid cost sports and outdoors retailer. Think youth sports, gym clothes, and camping/fishing /hunting gear. Their stores are often the only specialty retailer in a suburban area and some more heavily populated areas where ASO and Dicks compete (and in those area ASO wins every time). Their customers tend to be more blue-collar simpler consumers who would rather touch and feel the products vs order online for convenience, even though online sales have picked up drastically recently. Not having a strong online presence is not something that should turn you away from this stock. Nobody buys fishing equipment, camping gear, your child’s sports equipment online, these are things you want to touch and feel and try on and especially with this crowd of consumers.

Like I said I think investors look at covid lockdowns as if it were ASO’s best days, in fact I think this is why KKR ultimately decided to take them public after seeing 2 monster quarters back-to-back, they knew their valuation would be higher than it’s ever been and thought better take advantage of this fluke. I believe retailers are valued at IPO on their previous 2 quarters. But they didn’t expect to keep having monster record earnings afterwards so turns out they jumped the gun. Here’s why it will continue at least for a couple more quarters. Q2 last year we were completely shut down, sure exercise equipment and bike sales were through the roof, but youth sports and other sections came to a screeching halt. Now you have a massive reopening trade that will last a couple quarters longer as kids get back to each of their respective sports (each season) after a year hiatus and adults get back to their hobbies. Kids grow fast and I’m predicting this sector of the business will be on fire for a bit as parents have to replace outgrown equipment. This should bring more traffic to their stores than ever Academy is doing well and will continue to do well because they have a massive loyal following in the South with a product mix that’s borderline recession proof and mostly resilient to online retailers.

Comps

21’ Guidance compared to 19’ Pre-Covid

\-  Q2 Net Income at $560,000,000 up from $120,000,000 in 2019– increase of 352%

\-  Net Sales at $6.5B up from $4.8B in 2019 – increase of 35% 

\-  EPS - $5.45-$5.80 up from $1.60 – increase of 252%

21’ guidance compared to 20’ numbers (keep in mind 20’ was thought to be their record fluke sales year)

\-  Q2 Net Income at $560,000,000 up from $309,000,000 in 2020 – increase of 76%

\-  Net Sales at $6.5B up from 5.689B in 2020 – increase of 15%

\-  EPS - $5.45-$5.80 up from $3.79 in 2020 – increase of 48%

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Other bullish indicators

\-  Gross margin increased 29.4% to $642.5 million, the highest quarterly gross profit in the Company's history. The gross margin rate improved by 500 basis points to 35.9%. This growth was primarily driven by stronger merchandise margins from a favorable product mix shift, higher average unit retails and less promotional activity.

\-  The company also took steps to enhance its balance sheet. As of the end of the second quarter, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $553.8 million with no outstanding balance on its credit facility. Adjusted free cash flow was $169.5 million. Merchandise inventories were $1.1 billion, an increase of 24.0% compared to the prior year quarter and 3.2% compared to Q1 2021.

\-  Academy's largest shareholder (KKR) completed two transactions, reducing their ownership to approximately 20% of the Company as of the end of the quarter.

\-  As part of one of these events, Academy purchased and retired 3.2 million shares for approximately $100 million.

\-  In addition to the stock repurchase, the Company paid down $99 million of its outstanding term loan and refinanced the loan's interest rate from LIBOR + 5.0% to LIBOR + 3.75%. Based on these positive actions, S&amp;P (B+ from B) and Moody's (Ba3 from B1) both upgraded the Company's debt rating.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Im long 6,350 shares at $37.30 basis. 

I'll let others talk about the Short Interest attached to ASO and any potential squeezes. I think its a buy  with easy 50-100% upside regardless of any of that. That would all be bonus. But if this thing does move to $50-$55 quickly it could really trap some of the shorts and gap up pretty quickly.

I am 30 y/o and used to fap multiple times a day because my wife’ s boyfriend won’ t let me touch my wife, so I have to spend most of the time with my left hand (yes left handed).

There’ s only one problem I must face: I can only fap on my own loss porn. I mean really, I have tried a lot of different styles and other people’ s loss porn but it just never feels as familiar and intimate as with my own.

It has gotten such a bad addiction that I have to lose a lot of money at least 3 times a day for not stacking too much blood in my penis.

This is the whole reason I came to WSB in the first place because I thought apes here will help me out for sure. On my journey to find some huge losses I immediately bought some GME at $50. I was very disappointed by the performance and not turned on at all so I had to sell it at $350 and went on to buy puts in order to finally lose some money. Unfortunately, the price went down and I won again.

At this point in time my dick was so hard that I really had to print some losses so I could finally release some pressure. I doubled down my GSAT positions at $1, and put the rest into TSLA calls because betting against Michael Burry would lose me money for sure right?

Wrong again, Papa Musk and some shit rumors that happened over there at Apple pushed prices up again. I had to close my positions in green again to reduce opportunity cost by saving time to find something where I could lose money and finally finish off my job.

I am very desperate and depressed right now, since I’ m on WSB I’ ve only won money and did not lose a single dollar.

My last hope is reaching out to the biggest loss porn experts in here for advice of how I can start losing again to rub one off.

If you have read my previous posts you propably know I had to learn about this the hard way. It came as a shock to me. Dan basically told me HE is the real father of my kids (Dan and Dan). I first was confused, ""HOW? You are not even married?!"".

Apparantly this is not how any of this works (according to Dan). So this is a heads up for you guys. I did not, however, ask for further details.

Based on the advice given in this community I decided to ask Dan yesterday wether it was okay for me to have sex with my wife. He thought I wasn't ready yet. ""You should watch us doing it first, go hide in the closet"", he said.

Next thing you know I'm hiding in his closet and what do you know, my wife walks in to the room. ""Finally someone who does not talk about PLTR all the time, He's been talking about yoloing his pension savings all day"", she said. ""Yeah he should buy puts on GME"", said Dan (what a stupid monkey, I thought) while unzipping his pants. I, very confused about their opninion on PLTR and why Dan was about to pee, kept watching closely. ""When is the sex going to happen?"", I thought. 

Then Dan suddenly attacked my wife with his schlong! Sticking it INSIDE her?! I was scared. Was he going to kill her? My wife started yelling, so naturally I started yelling to. Then she screamed: ""AHHHH!!! Who is that inside the closit?!"".

Than Dan responded, ""I don't know, but he sure looks a lot like your husband tho"", I guess Dan forgot I was there.

So after coming out of the closet my wife got REALLY mad at me for sneaking around like that. Maybe she's right? What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here?

Also, my wife told me she's pregnant with another baby. A boy, and she's going to call him Dan.

No doubt you've seen the IRNT posts about the unique situation arising from a low float and high call options. Well I've got news for you: I've been watching $OPAD like a hawk and it looks to be ramping up into the exact same situation as IRNT, and yet somehow you apes haven't realized this yet. If you're sad you missed out on IRNT and you think underwater mining is bullshit, then have I got the play for you. And you can actually seemingly get in early on this one too. I've been accumulating my position in OPAD since last Tuesday while watching the gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential increase every day. Read on for what I know, and buckle up cause this is a big one…

# Background

&amp;#x200B;

First, some background on the company. Offerpad ($OPAD) is an iBuyer company with a current market cap of 2.636B.

https://preview.redd.it/6wxq4xw4bon71.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3beaf0d4855963388afc86057c8f74523ca2c797

An iBuyer is basically a company that uses their technology to make quick offers to home sellers, then re-sell those homes themselves for profit. Think Redfin, Zillow, Opendoor - those are OPAD's competitors.

Offerpad de-SPACed just a few weeks ago and started trading as OPAD on September 2. For some reason investors fucking hated this thing, so prior to the ticker change the SPAC had a huge percent of redemptions just like IRNT - a whopping 92% redemption rate. As a result, there are now only 3,387,913 shares in the free float until PIPE unlocks (TBD at this point). And, just like IRNT, OPAD has fallen into this retarded loophole created by the genius SEC where it somehow has options even though the current float is technically too small for listing options.

[Redemption info from OPAD's super 8K filing - a legal filing our SEC overlords make each SPAC file when it completes its merger and de-SPACs](https://preview.redd.it/1vjw8d48bon71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75752ce6d62b95ac0731442ef2fdb5da9c49580b)

As a result of the low float the stock has been extremely volatile since it began trading as OPAD on 9/2. It's seen 10-20% intraday swings pretty much every day since the ticker change. If you had just been trading those dips you'd actually probably be pretty fucking rich by now. OPAD even reached a high of $16 last Thursday. Just as it was starting to gamma squeeze into orbit, though, it was shorted to shit Thursday into Friday and eventually closed Friday down almost 40% from that $16 high. More on that shorting below - point is, this is super volatile and therefore also a high risk play. If that's too scary for you, though, then why the fuck are you on [r/WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/) in the first place? Go back to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and your 3 fund portfolio.

Also, if you're a smooth brain who obsesses over technical analysis - OPAD looks to have had a nearly perfect gap fill yesterday and has since started to take off into orbit (up 29% from that low end of day Tuesday).

Closed 9/3 at $8.63 and gapped up to open 9/7 at $10.09. On 9/3 retraced back down to $8.60 for all of one minute before bouncing back up.

# Gamma Squeeze - Market Makers Fucked

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, now to the really good stuff. I know as soon as you read ""gamma squeeze"" in the title your itty bitty micropeen got hard as a thumbtack, so let me give you some porn to jack off to.

Just like IRNT, OPAD's options can put market makers in the position where they would need to buy over 100% of OPAD's current float in order to hedge their risk from writing options to retards like you all on WSB - and frankly, it's not that hard for OPAD to reach the point where this would happen. As further OTM call options become in the money, market makers will have to buy more and more of these shares to sell to you if you decide to exercise the contract. This is because of the options Greeks Delta and Gamma. Now normally I know that for you retards ""options Greeks"" usually means the options your wife's Greek boyfriend tells you to buy, but for this play Delta and Gamma are super important.

Since I know you dgaf about options Greeks, let me try to dumb it down for you apes with a picture:

https://preview.redd.it/2pluvjwjbon71.png?width=1747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892bf16fa9e8a9325c69b8808fbad066e460a6bb

Based on the options open interest as of yesterday, if OPAD reached $16 then market makers would need to hedge 98.21% of the current float. At Wednesday's close price, only 29.72% of the float would need to be hedged - still a huge amount, but clearly this thing has room to run. And on top of that, OPAD already managed to reach $16 last Thursday before it was swatted down by short sellers.

Right now, as the price increases past $16 market makers would need to buy less and less additional stock to hedge since the stock price becomes further and further from the open options interest. If more people buy more OTM options, though, then the price could run even higher because market makers would need to buy even more stock even after the price runs (aka the situation IRNT is in right now). This is delta and gamma at play, and what can create a gamma squeeze. This covering would be incredibly difficult for market makers to do because of the low number of stock available in the float. OPAD already briefly reached $16 last Thursday and OPAD's options volume and open interest has been steadily increasing, so who knows what the fuck could happen over the next few days as we head into September options expiration.

Also, since you're a degenerate and have likely already started to buy options on this shit before even finishing my DD you may have noticed that OPAD's options open interest and volume is much lower than IRNT's. For one, this is probably because you apes haven't caught wind of OPAD until right now and haven't yet started buying large amounts of retardedly OTM calls. However, even with the lower overall open interest there is still a ton of potential.

Here is OPAD's total open interest and volume since I started tracking it last week:

https://preview.redd.it/3ahxfhvmbon71.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=592b7835a2304db6ab812fdccfd9fb680b477ab8

https://preview.redd.it/puvnpdmobon71.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e5d576a1ba05856cbe93449daa6b8c72cae3791

Here's OPAD's OI and most recent volume for September expiration compared to IRNT, as of the end of the day Wednesday:

&amp;#x200B;

||OPAD|IRNT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Puts - OI|3,326|25,276|
|Calls - OI|19,369|58,031|
|Put-Call Ratio - OI|0.17|0.44|
|Puts - Volume|1,605|9,719|
|Calls - Volume|16,205|41,787|
|Put-Call Ratio - Volume|0.10|0.23|

While the total number of calls (for all strikes and for September) is lower than IRNT, there are pretty much no puts open for OPAD whereas IRNT has almost half as many open puts as calls. Puts that market makers sell counteract the hedging that market makers need to do when price increases in order to cover the calls they sell, so for OPAD a much lower relative number of puts means that the open calls could still require market makers to hedge a large volume of shares even if there are less total calls than IRNT. To dumb it down for you apes - less put mean slightly less call still go big boom.

And all of this isn't even accounting for you dumbass apes who love short-dated OTM options. Just like GME, stock buying is what can really get this going. But, more options open interest means that the gamma squeeze potential will only increase.

# Short Interest - Short Sellers Fucked

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y56rygbybon71.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb999d9ecbf55fe076aae8dbf20f5f8cc49a7977

[I know short squeezes are like crack to you people, and I'm here to feed your addiction.](https://preview.redd.it/jck8gau0con71.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc05bf4a5ebb91d0c4ceba8067c56f69ad856da5)

As I mentioned earlier, ever since OPAD started to run last week it's been getting hammered by short sellers. To begin with, even taking out the gamma squeeze considerations with OPAD it's a retarded idea to short this stock right now. OPAD is a legitimate growth stock with many signs that it's significantly undervalued right now and could likely be a nice return even if you were to just buy and hold. For example, OPAD's 2021 projected revenue is $1.7-$1.85 billion. With their current market cap, they would only be trading at a 1.55 multiple; OPAD's peers are trading at multiple times higher than that. Even if all outstanding warrants are executed and after PIPE unlock, this stock will still be undervalued relative to its peers.

The crazy thing about the shorting is that according to Ortex, short sellers have now managed to accumulate a total short interest of 5.33 million - which is **157% of the current float**. Short interest **increased 36% yesterday**, cost to borrow reached as high as **220.08%**, and **utilization is at 99.98%** (aka there are pretty much no shares left to short).

https://preview.redd.it/btsivxm2con71.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=684fd041c0a8b15af0761fed6ed835d88b9a1634

https://preview.redd.it/0fvtcdr3con71.png?width=1259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1948a30365647cadf2459096e789bbe99c1c211

Short sellers would already need to purchase 1.5x the current float to fully cover their positions. However - remember what I said earlier about the market makers needing to buy stocks to cover the calls they're writing to you retards? Because the market makers are doing that, there would be even less shares for short sellers to cover with. This is how you get to infinity squeeze potential - there just wouldn't be nearly enough shares available for everyone to buy what they need to cover. This gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential is also exactly what happened with GME back in January. It's almost like these dumbass short sellers haven't learned a damn thing.

It also seems that these short sellers caught on to this risk and really don't want this thing to blast off. And I take offense to that - I want my tendies. These huge drops in price were rally killers. If you check the open interest from Ortex above you'll see the huge increase in short interest after last Thursday.

[Shorts fucking with OPAD when it started to take off last Thursday](https://preview.redd.it/mr2cfuu4con71.png?width=1666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=359769d5f4676a797ecff357c00ad0f47fe90927)

[Shorts fucking with OPAD again when it started to take off Wednesday](https://preview.redd.it/dpsq83p5con71.png?width=1670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79f80e9a93511d65bb9c10f457249823e70a8b07)

What's great is that even though this has been significantly beaten down by short sellers, OPAD has come right back after each dip you see above. This thing just cannot be beaten.

https://preview.redd.it/eht6wkq7con71.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=570e9c1bd82e51863c34106b5666d0e8fa91e483

More importantly, though, is that since these short sellers seem to just keep doubling down each time this thing starts to blast off they will be extra mega-fucked once it actually does achieve liftoff. Each time they double down on their shorting they are just adding more fuel to the fire. More than that, if the folks shorting OPAD are the same ones shorting other low float stocks like IRNT, and OPAD pops alongside those other stocks - we very well could see short sellers getting margin called from multiple positions turning extremely against them all at once just like we saw back in January/February with GME, AMC, etc.

https://preview.redd.it/c4s8y6k8con71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=572dfc1c1e7a6baf03e1fe610864b755ce7b8547

So, there you have it--yet another gamma squeeze/short squeeze stock for you to go apeshit over. Good luck, this one should be lit.

Oh, also - positions below. I didn't sell last Thursday during the run, instead I've been steadily buying more. This baby still has lots of room to run and has yet to truly pop.

This week I was struggling to find plays… UNTIL NOW! IronNet is set up perfectly to turn that tiny dong of yours into an IRON-hard MASSIVE green cock!

At first I was skeptical of this play because most ‘squeeze’ plays are shitty P&amp;D’s… but the more I looked into IRNT, the more I realized that this is a legitimate play which has the potential to 5X or MORE

Let me explain…

&amp;#x200B;

**Low Float:**

IRNT technically has a float of 84.4m, but because it was recently a SPAC merger, any shares held by (the SPAC) or insiders are locked up for the next few months…

This means in reality ONLY 5.76M shares are able to physically be sold and ONLY 2.528M can be traded!

https://preview.redd.it/p8zcdt1y2on71.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7beb7dbabacf05d4b9c8b1ff5476ca629e073a17

Additionally, because of the lock-up agreement, IRNT is unable to issue ANY additional shares so there is no way they can increase the float

What this means is any options/shares you purchase will have a MUCH larger impact on the stock price

A low float also makes gamma squeezes WAY more likely because every share an MM purchases to delta hedge and/or sell a call is a larger percentage of the overall float

If the ITM open interest exceeds the amount of available shares, MM's are LITERALLY unable to get enough shares to cover their side of the transaction which will send this to the FUCKING MOON

&amp;#x200B;

**Options:**

Now here is where it gets interesting...

On its own IRNT's open interest is crazy, but once you factor in the tradable float you start to realize how fucking high this stock could go

https://preview.redd.it/4ebhx2fz2on71.png?width=318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fab60a19d8b27b1d1cb4cce9e3a1fe942f5683a7

IRNT has 50,984 calls expiring on 9/17 with many already being ITM. This means that up to 5.1M shares will be locked up in these contracts

This is INSANE! Literally 2X the tradable float! And unlike short sellers, MM’s need to buy all these shares by a set deadline. This means that 4.4M shares will need to be purchased and all locked up at THE SAME TIME!

It is physically IMPOSSIBLE for MM’s to get enough shares for the 9/17 expiry because there literally aren’t EVEN enough tradable shares in existence

And unlike GME or AMC, IRNT is unable to issue ANY new shares

I don’t even know how MM's will survive this… All I know is that I am going to get FUCKING RICH

&amp;#x200B;

**Positions:**

5 $19.5 C 9/17,  2 $20 C 9/17, 3 $21 C 9/17, 3 $22.5 C 9/17, 10 $24 C 9/17, 10 $25 10/15 C, 10 $28 18/15 C

&amp;#x200B;

No doubt you've seen the IRNT posts about the unique situation arising from a low float and high call options. Well I've got news for you: I've been watching $OPAD like a hawk and it looks to be ramping up into the exact same situation as IRNT, and yet somehow you apes haven't realized this yet. If you're sad you missed out on IRNT and you think underwater mining is bullshit, then have I got the play for you. And you can actually seemingly get in early on this one too. I've been accumulating my position in OPAD since last Tuesday while watching the gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential increase every day. Read on for what I know, and buckle up cause this is a big one…

[OPAD is where IRNT was two weeks ago](https://preview.redd.it/kopo41qi0on71.png?width=1659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fa9bd589b6e989c14493ab979948c24b2cf3a12)

# Background

First, some background on the company. Offerpad ($OPAD) is an [iBuyer](https://www.opendoor.com/w/guides/what-is-an-ibuyer) company with a current market cap of 2.636B.

https://preview.redd.it/e4g6s6siamn71.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3292896c840518ad8dca8c86fd086e423a0e25db

An iBuyer is basically a company that uses  their technology to make quick offers to home sellers, then re-sell those homes themselves for profit. Think Redfin, Zillow, Opendoor - those are OPAD's competitors.

&amp;#x200B;

Offerpad de-SPACed just a few weeks ago and started trading as OPAD on September 2. For some reason investors fucking hated this thing, so prior to the ticker change the SPAC had a huge percent of redemptions just like IRNT -  a whopping 92% redemption rate. As a result, there are now only 3,387,913 shares in the free float until PIPE unlocks (TBD at this point). And, just like IRNT, OPAD has fallen into this retarded loophole created by the genius SEC where it somehow has options even though the current float is technically too small for listing options.

[Redemption info from OPAD's super 8K filing - a legal filing our SEC overlords make each SPAC file when it completes its merger and de-SPACs](https://preview.redd.it/c0fwvvokamn71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41d5bfd15c519bb5e2dd2d9f5920ed174aa9dec8)

As a result of the low float the stock has been extremely volatile since it began trading as OPAD on 9/2. It's seen 10-20% intraday swings pretty much every day since the ticker change. If you had just been trading those dips you'd actually probably be pretty fucking rich by now. OPAD even reached a high of $16 last Thursday. Just as it was starting to gamma squeeze into orbit, though, it was shorted to shit Thursday into Friday and eventually closed Friday down almost 40% from that $16 high. More on that shorting below - point is, this is super volatile and therefore also a high risk play. If that's too scary for you, though, then why the fuck are you on /r/WSB in the first place? Go back to /r/investing and your 3 fund portfolio.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you're a smooth brain who obsesses over technical analysis - OPAD looks to have had a nearly perfect gap fill yesterday and has since started to take off into orbit (up 29% from that low end of day Tuesday).

[Closed 9\/3 at $8.63 and gapped up to open 9\/7 at $10.09. On 9\/3 retraced back down to $8.60 for all of one minute before bouncing back up.](https://preview.redd.it/nuiaio9mamn71.png?width=1669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8f9e3c95adbb878e638893438837dee3d49118e)

# Gamma Squeeze - Market Makers Fucked

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, now to the really good stuff. I know as soon as you read ""gamma squeeze"" in the title your itty bitty micropeen got hard as a thumbtack, so let me give you some porn to jack off to.

&amp;#x200B;

Just like IRNT, OPAD's options can put market makers in the position where they would need to buy over 100% of OPAD's current float in order to hedge their risk from writing options to retards like you all on WSB - and frankly, it's not that hard for OPAD to reach the point where this would happen. As further OTM call options become in the money, market makers will have to buy more and more of these shares to sell to you if you decide to exercise the contract. This is because of the options Greeks Delta and Gamma. Now normally I know that for you retards ""options Greeks"" usually means the options your wife's Greek boyfriend tells you to buy, but for this play Delta and Gamma are super important.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I know you dgaf about options Greeks, let me try to dumb it down for you apes with a picture:

https://preview.redd.it/hz0kcy6ramn71.png?width=1747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=339f23ff1cb64170eb0e7acb54f24a391d2778fa

Based on the current options open interest, if OPAD reached $16 then market makers would need to hedge 98.21% of the current float. At Wednesday's close price, only 29.72% of the float would need to be hedged - still a huge amount, but clearly this thing has room to run. And on top of that, OPAD already managed to reach $16 last Thursday before it was swatted down by short sellers.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, as the price increases past $16 market makers would need to buy less and less additional stock to hedge since the stock price becomes further and further from the open options interest. If more people buy more  OTM options, though, then the price could run even higher because market makers would need to buy even more stock even after the price runs (aka the situation IRNT is in right now). This is delta and gamma at play, and what can create a gamma squeeze. This covering would be incredibly difficult for market makers to do because of the low number of stock available in the float. OPAD already briefly reached $16 last Thursday and OPAD's options volume and open interest has been steadily increasing, so who knows what the fuck could happen over the next few days as we head into September options expiration.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, since you're a degenerate and have likely already started to buy options on this shit before even finishing my DD you may have noticed that OPAD's options open interest and volume is much lower than IRNT's. For one, this is probably because you apes haven't caught wind of OPAD until right now and haven't yet started buying large amounts of retardedly OTM calls. However, even with the lower overall open interest there is still a ton of potential.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is OPAD's total open interest and volume since I started tracking it last week:

https://preview.redd.it/h1loqynsamn71.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e04ed0333bcd045d279a530ec861e9662f2ec65

https://preview.redd.it/1ufjnfjtamn71.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63400135150afdb4e406388ddfc2601a9e16977b

Here's OPAD's OI and most recent volume for September expiration compared to IRNT, as of the end of the day Wednesday:

||OPAD|IRNT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Puts - OI|3,326|25,276|
|Calls - OI|19,369|58,031|
|Put-Call Ratio - OI|0.17|0.44|
|Puts - Volume|1,605|9,719|
|Calls - Volume|16,205|41,787|
|Put-Call Ratio - Volume|0.10|0.23|

While the total number of calls (for all strikes and for September) is lower than IRNT, there are pretty much no puts open for OPAD whereas IRNT has almost half as many open puts as calls. Puts that market makers sell counteract the hedging that market makers need to do when price increases in order to cover the calls they sell, so for OPAD a much lower relative number of puts means that the open calls could still require market makers to hedge a large volume of shares even if there are less total calls than IRNT. To dumb it down for you apes - less put mean slightly less call still go big boom.

&amp;#x200B;

And all of this isn't even accounting for you dumbass apes who love short-dated OTM options. Just like GME, stock buying is what can really get this going. But, more options open interest means that the gamma squeeze potential will only increase.

&amp;#x200B;

# Short Interest - Short Sellers Fucked

[I know short squeezes are like crack to you people, and I'm here to feed your addiction.](https://preview.redd.it/klejf1iwamn71.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75c07e6b7d553ce9b1eb9a42c311e43885f29086)

As I mentioned earlier, ever since OPAD started to run last week it's been getting hammered by short sellers. To begin with, even taking out the gamma squeeze considerations with OPAD it's a retarded idea to short this stock right now. OPAD is a legitimate growth stock with many signs that it's significantly undervalued right now and could likely be a nice return even if you were to just buy and hold. For example, OPAD's 2021 projected revenue is $1.7-$1.85 billion. With their current market cap, they would only be trading at a 1.55 multiple; OPAD's peers are trading at multiple times higher than that. Even if all outstanding warrants are executed and after PIPE unlock, this stock will still be undervalued relative to its peers.

&amp;#x200B;

The crazy thing about the shorting is that according to Ortex, short sellers have now managed to accumulate a total short interest of 5.33 million - which is **157% of the current float**. Short interest **increased 36% yesterday**, cost to borrow reached as high as **220.08%**, and **utilization is at 99.98%** (aka there are pretty much no shares left to short).

Short sellers would already need to purchase 1.5x the current float to fully cover their positions. However - remember what I said earlier about the market makers needing to buy stocks to cover the calls they're writing to you retards? Because the market makers are doing that, there would be even less shares for short sellers to cover with. This is how you get to infinity squeeze potential - there just wouldn't be nearly enough shares available for everyone to buy what they need to cover. This gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential is also exactly what happened with GME back in January. It's almost like these dumbass short sellers haven't learned a damn thing.

&amp;#x200B;

It also seems that these short sellers caught on to this risk and really don't want this thing to blast off. And I take offense to that - I want my tendies. These huge drops in price were rally killers. If you check the open interest from Ortex above you'll see the huge increase in short interest after last Thursday.

[Shorts fucking with OPAD again when it started to take off Wednesday](https://preview.redd.it/wq0x8ju2bmn71.png?width=1670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89ce1c1f1ae0f0609c9d8ca6007f339e623c71dd)

What's great is that even though this has been significantly beaten down by short sellers, OPAD has come right back after each dip you see above. This thing just cannot be beaten.

More importantly, though, is that since these short sellers seem to just keep doubling down each time this thing starts to blast off they will be extra mega-fucked once it actually does achieve liftoff. Each time they double down on their shorting they are just adding more fuel to the fire. More than that, if the folks shorting OPAD are the same ones shorting other low float stocks like IRNT, and OPAD pops alongside those other stocks - we very well could see short sellers getting margin called from multiple positions turning extremely against them all at once just like we saw back in January/February with GME, AMC, etc.

So, there you have it--yet another gamma squeeze/short squeeze stock for you to go apeshit over. Good luck, this one should be lit.

Oh, also  - positions below. I didn't sell last Thursday during the run, instead I've been steadily buying more. This baby still has lots of room to run and has yet to truly pop.

Because the company has only been trading for 2 weeks, it's hard to analyze technicals other than volume. Thankfully, the short interest and float are the main reasons why this stock presents such a great opportunity, so those will be analyzed below.

**\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Investing is risky and high short interest plays are even riskier. You should talk to a financial professional before making any investment decisions and should do your own research\***

**Short Interest Stats and Analysis**

To put it simply, the short interest on IRNT is absolutely insane. Combine that with the fact that it's a newly trading company (and susceptible to more volatility) and has a VERY low float, and you have a recipe for an absolute slam dunk.

First, let's take a look at Fintel and iBorrow desk. iBorrowdesk has consistently shown the borrow fee to be over 500% and the available shares to be far below 10,000. Similarly, fintel has consistently showed less than 1,000 shares available to borrow. Though some people don't trust these sites, the similarities in the data help to add credibility

I'd also like to turn your attention to [this post by another WSB user](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/). This post analyzes how the extremely low float of this stock due to it being a new stock and the insane option OI presents the opportunity for a legitimate gamma squeeze - not some fake hype run up - a legitimate gamma squeeze similar to GME's first run up.

If you look at websites like Baron's they'll tell you that the SI as a % of the float is only 1.79% (about 700,000 shares). This is correct but doesn't tell the whole story. Because of redemptions and lockups, the actual float is 1.3m shares, which makes the real short interest on tradable shares about 56%. Interestingly, [Ihor's tweet](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1437512870351282177?s=19) shows that the borrow fee is asininely high, which again shows the difficulty of borrowing of this stock and thus the easy possibility of a short squeeze. 56% short interest is an amazing number in and of itself, but that's not the whole story. The thing about this stock that really gets me going is the options activity. The OI on options of this stock is absolutely bananas right now. Remember when I said that there are about 1.3M tradable shares due to it being a new stock post-merger? Well, at a $20 price, almost double that amount is held in ITM calls alone. THAT is why the stock has serious gamma squeeze potential. Remember, both the GME and VW squeezes happened because ITM options OI outnumbered the float of companies that were already heavily shorted - this is the power of a gamma squeeze. Most meme stocks that have been ""squeezing"" recently have been small short squeezes due to retail traders and HFs taking advantage of social sentiment. The reason that we haven't seen a violent squeeze recently is because there hasn't been a stock with options activity like this - until IRNT.

Additionally, you probably saw that the stock went up to almost $40 last week out of nowhere. Again, this is the power of a low float stock with high ITM call OI. If this stock starts picking up, the low float and call OI could propel it to meme stock legend status.

Furthermore, data from ortex has also consistently shown a SI of over 300% and a cost to borrow over 500%, which is consistent with the sources listed above. Yes, the SI is definitely a plus, but again, the real power here is the gamma squeeze potential.

(The above four paragraph's were heavily borrowed from the originally linked user, so please check out his post).

Many people will probably not believe some of these shorting numbers and will consider them unreliable because of how new the stock is. That's understandable. However, if you're in that camp, let me present to you this: the NYSE's regulationSHO FTD list. Per SEC regulations, stocks that reach over a certain amount of FTDs are placed on regulation SHO's threshold list. This is a very small list and identifies stocks that are grossly over-shorted (FTDs being the evidence of that). GME was on this list for a very long time before it squeezed. So if you don't believe the websites's SI numbers, then you at least have to believe the NYSE's numbers about FTDs. When a stock has too many FTDs, it means that it is extremely hard to locate shares and repay borrowers, which is a sign of over-shorting. Here is the NYSE list:

https://preview.redd.it/z5q0vbtmxjn71.png?width=2710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e76c960abd9f88936b898b3dbebbf5d82519a9cb

Notice the second to last one? DING DING DING. Though being on the threshold list signifies overshorting, there is yet another thing that we can take from this - forced covering. IRNT has been on that list since 9/2. Per regulationSHO, after 6 TRADING days on the list (9/10), stricter location requirements for shorting are put in place. Take a look at the giant green uptick that we saw on 9/10. 13 TRADING days on the list and forced coverings start taking place where a market-maker is subject to fines and loses his or her market making abilities if this regulation is violated. 13 TRADING days after 9/2 is 9/21. Remember all of those call options I talked about above, well they will be exercised on Friday 9/17. So, let's review what we have: an extremely high reported short interest (you can believe it's 600%, 300%, 56%, whatever), an extremely low an restricted float, ITM options expiring on Friday that outnumber the total float, the stock being on the threshold list indicating over-shorting, forced coverings taking place right around when those options would have to be delivered. Again, this is exactly what we saw with GME. It's important to note however, that this is also an issue of timing - the stock is likely to have a gamma squeeze sometime late this week and through next week. After that, there's a good chance that covering could lead to the stock being taken off of the threshold list.

**Fundamentals**

Think that IRNT is just a squeezable meme stock with no long term potential as an investment? Wrong. The stock is not like most meme stocks - it actually is a good underlying business. According to an article by a website not allowed on here (just copy and past the quote in google to find it), ""With the company’s international expansion, M&amp;A initiatives, and cloud acceleration, under my most optimistic case scenario, the company is worth $55 per share. If IronNet continues to sign agreements with nation states and companies like CrowdStrike did, I believe that the upside potential is significant."" The article discusses how the company's AI initiatives, cyber security focus, and cloud acceleration, all of which are some of the most important and up and coming technology sectors, poise it to go up in value significantly. Additionally, the company also just reported earnings. Though the earnings were lower than expected, take a look at the after hours activity - the shorts have no juice left.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

So there you have it. in my opinion, IRNT is an EXTREMELY good stock fundamentally so I will be holding it long term. HOWEVER, the stock also presents a rare gamma squeeze - short squeeze opportunity that retail hasn't seen since GME. The stock has an extremely high reported short interest, an extremely small float, open interest on ITM call options that outnumbers the current float, is on the regulationSHO threshold list indicating that it has extremely high short interest and possible naked shorting, has been on that list for a significant amount of time, and the ITM options that outnumber the float are expiring right around when shorts would be forced to cover their FTDs. In other words, an absolute grand slam.

What is everyone talking about?, the “Big Crash”, the mother of all bears was supposed to happen like a year ago 😂

Everyone knows a “crash” or correction is coming.

But know one knows when and it sure won’t be like this lol.

A real crash or sudden correction will be quick and swift and/or have drastic movement.

No one on WSB is worried about a crash. Fuck the majority of us just bet on calls and puts and are probably liquid or in the red already.

I’ve come to the personal conclusion that GME can sustain its position through an apocalypse. SPY will never die. Burry might be right but who fucking cares, stop lying we’re all here to make money. 

This market doesn’t make sense, now deal with it and move on. Shit will be green in a couple days.

AAPL: The apple event was a huge bust and the stock has tumbled one entire percent on the news that the next iphone is going to be 5% better than the current iPhone, as always. Mentions really began to spike at the start of the event.

FCEL: A new ticker on this list. FCEL is up 12%. I believe they are reporting earnings today after the bell, so watch the fuk out.

CLOV: 10 million apes waiting for the CLOV squeeze to happen. The stock is pretty much flat today and only down 0.5% instead of 10% for once.

TSLA &amp; GME: These bad boys are always on the top 5 list. GME squeeze will happen any day now. Keep an eye out for posts that say ""Why GME should be $10,000 per share""... those kinds of posts are usually filled with ~~genius~~ autistic advice

It is estimated that billions of unicorns are flowing through the darkpool with low nasdaq volume but daily volume of over 70% coming from the naked shorts in the darkpool daily.  Not only are they creating shares to short, they are resetting the shorted shares return clock (FTD loophole), to return these shares within 35 days under the SEC rules for FTDs and creating shares out of the ones stuck in limbo.

If you haven't beaten the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you got a bit unlucky. If you've managed to beat the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you're an investing god. That ego can make you broke, and now is the time for a humility check. 

You're in this subreddit. If you're reading this, do you think you're better than the top investors out there- Burry, Dalio, Wood, Buffet? Well, maybe you are, but statistically, you're probably not. 

So, what do the top investors say lately? Here's my interpretation:

Burry: We're in the biggest speculative bubble of all time in all things.   
Assets under management (AUM): $635 million

Dalio: US Bonds are crap, US equities are frothy, tech is bubble-ish. Get into emerging markets. China isn't so bad.   
AUM: $140 billion

Buffet: I'll reduce my positions and wait for a better entry.  
AUM: $632 billion

Wood: Innovation will lead to enormous GDP and productivity growth over the next 5-10 years.   
AUM: $53 billion

=============================================

If you've been following financial news this year you probably know that Burry started shorting TSLA back in Dec 2020 and has been crying wolf that we're in a bubble since this spring. Ever since then the market has gone up a lot. Doesn't that make him wrong this time? Not necessarily, no. In fact, that means we might be in an even bigger bubble than we were earlier this year. Luckily for him, seems like he learned from last time to hedge his shorts too, and bought FB and GOOG calls in case the market continues to rocket, which have printed hard. 

 Speculation is at an all-time high. Look at this chart of subscriber count for WSB:

[I'm guessing most of these new subscribers aren't YOLOing on OTM SPY puts every week.](https://preview.redd.it/50kiiie6zbn71.png?width=3010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c4c7817c548515eae1823cc2f0e986565522ea9)

Take a look at this chart of TSLA

https://preview.redd.it/jhh5i2tfzbn71.png?width=2492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c354ae8100a048cf81176d619ddaaa5f51b4dda

And compare it to the standard asset bubble chart here:

https://preview.redd.it/hngourvbycn71.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9175668887dbb1f5639fd54ce395c38865b0a879

Now with fundamentals way off, TA lining up, and lots of possible macroeconomic issues in the near future, this looks to me like a great setup for a short. Now of course, nothing is certain in the markets. BUT, if the bubble is about to pop, this could be the trading opportunity of a lifetime. That's why I'm going short. 

""Burry is a value-shill permabear""

Burry was long on a bunch of equities at the bottom of the pandemic last year, he bought GME at $5. [https://www.yahoo.com/now/michael-burry-doubles-money-3-174031896.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/michael-burry-doubles-money-3-174031896.html). He has consistently beaten the market in bad years and good years too. 

""Burry is smart but he is wrong about TSLA""

If you won't follow Burry, then how about following Wood?[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/09/09/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-110-million-in-tesla-stock-as-insiders-also-dump-shares/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/09/09/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-110-million-in-tesla-stock-as-insiders-also-dump-shares/)

[https://www.reuters.com/technology/cathie-woods-ark-funds-bought-246-million-coinbase-shares-2021-04-15/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cathie-woods-ark-funds-bought-246-million-coinbase-shares-2021-04-15/)

""Cathie Wood gives TSLA a $3k price target""

Wood, Dalio, and Buffet have such high AUM that their positions can be highly illiquid. That is, even if they knew they positions were overvalued, they aren't always able to get out of before causing panic in the underlying. For this reason, you always have to take what they say with a grain of salt. Wood, who is a brilliant investor, would obviously not say that TSLA is overvalued, same that Dalio will not say that BABA is a risky stock to hold. It's a perfect case of ""do as I say, not as I do."" So instead of listening to what they say, which is always going to be biased, try looking at what they do. 

And lately, Wood has been selling TSLA. When the **bulls start selling**, it might be a good time to get out.

This week I may have found the BEST play I have EVER FOUND! IronNet is set up perfectly to turn that tiny dong of yours into an IRON-hard MASSIVE green cock!

At first I was skeptical of this play because most ‘squeeze’ plays are shitty P&amp;D’s… but the more I looked into IronNet, the more I realised that this is a legitimate play which has the potential to 5X or MORE

Let me explain…

&amp;#x200B;

**Low Float:**

IronNet technically has a float of 84.4m, but because it was recently a SP\*AC merger, any shares held by DF\*NS (the SP\*AC) or insiders are locked up for the next few months…

This means in reality ONLY 5.76M shares are able to physically be sold and ONLY 2.528M can be traded! 

https://preview.redd.it/siw3duer5hn71.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6320ed43b9bdd95989d5701c3ed7e92414c4379

 Additionally, because of the lock-up agreement, IronNet is unable to issue ANY additional shares so there is no way they can increase the float

What this means is any options/shares you purchase will have a MUCH larger impact on the stock price

A low float also makes gamma squeezes WAY more likely because every share an MM purchases to delta hedge and/or sell a call is a larger percentage of the overall float

If the ITM open interest exceeds the amount of available shares, MM's are LITERALLY unable to get enough shares to cover their side of the transaction which will send this to the FUCKING MOON

&amp;#x200B;

**Options:**

Now here is where it gets interesting...

On its own IronNet’s open interest is crazy, but once you factor in the tradable float you start to realise how fucking high this stock could go

IronNet has 44,434 calls expiring on 9/17 with many already being ITM. This means that up to 4.4M shares will be locked in these contracts

This is INSANE! Literally 2X the tradable float! And unlike short sellers, MM’s need to buy all these shares by a set deadline. This means that 4.4M shares will need to be purchased and all locked up at THE SAME TIME  
It is physically IMPOSSIBLE for MM’s to get enough shares for the 9/17 expiry because there literally aren’t EVEN enough tradable shares in existence

And unlike GME or AMC, IronNet is unable to issue ANY new shares

I don’t even know how options sellers will survive this… All I know is that I am going to get FUCKING RICH

This week I may have found the BEST play I have EVER FOUND! IronNet is set up perfectly to turn that tiny dong of yours into an IRON-hard MASSIVE green cock!

At first I was skeptical of this play because most ‘squeeze’ plays are shitty P&amp;D’s… but the more I looked into IronNet, the more I realised that this is a legitimate play which has the potential to 5X or MORE

Let me explain…  


**Low Float:**

IronNet technically has a float of 84.4m, but because it was recently a SP\*AC merger, any shares held by DFNS (the SP\*AC) or insiders are locked up for the next few months…

This means in reality ONLY 5.76M shares are able to physically be sold and ONLY 2.528M can be traded!   


https://preview.redd.it/z3cfgcuq3hn71.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d02b6d7d74af1cc9f2fbaa0111cd47725f3f230

Additionally, because of the lock-up agreement, IronNet is unable to issue ANY additional shares so there is no way they can increase the float

What this means is any options/shares you purchase will have a MUCH larger impact on the stock price

A low float also makes gamma squeezes WAY more likely because every share an MM purchases to delta hedge and/or sell a call is a larger percentage of the overall float

If the ITM open interest exceeds the amount of available shares, MM's are LITERALLY unable to get enough shares to cover their side of the transaction which will send this to the FUCKING MOON  


**Options:**

Now here is where it gets interesting...

On its own IronNet’s open interest is crazy, but once you factor in the tradable float you start to realise how fucking high this stock could go

https://preview.redd.it/4e6la01u3hn71.png?width=319&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf86ed61a68a23f65f78186576a8a93f09070efd

IronNet has 44,434 calls expiring on 9/17 with many already being ITM. This means that up to 4.4M shares will be locked in these contracts

This is INSANE! Literally 2X the tradable float! And unlike short sellers, MM’s need to buy all these shares by a set deadline. This means that 4.4M shares will need to be purchased and all locked up at THE SAME TIME  
It is physically IMPOSSIBLE for MM’s to get enough shares for the 9/17 expiry because there literally aren’t EVEN enough tradable shares in existence

This company has a market cap of 1.58b according to marketwatch.com

""None of the subs I'm active on will take a post on this one since the market cap is too low. I've got to share it with someone, so the 57 of you following me directly may or may not see this.

To start with, I am super skeptical of anything that mentions the word ""squeeze."" Post-GME, it became a way to lure in suckers to be holding the dump after your pump. However, either this is going to be an honest to God gamma squeeze, or I've missed something big time.

Here's the background. LCL Sys Acquisition, a pretty good SPAC sponsor actually, acquired IronNet Cyber Security. However, 90% of the shares were redeemed last week. This brought the total float down to 1.2M shares. In addition, 1.5M shares from management were unlocked, giving us a total 2.7M shares available to trade.

Usually, options trading requires a much higher float than this. The CBOE requires a 7M share float (technically, 7M shares owned by holders without reporting requirements), and 2.4M shares traded in the last 12 months before allowing options trading. $IRNT is far below that, but before redemptions LGL Sys Acquisitions wasn't. This has created a bit of a hole in the .C.B.O.E liquidity rulebook.

What does that mean for us? Well, there are a huge number of options being traded and a huge OI growing by the day. There are something like 40k total call options outstanding and more than 30k in September expiries alone, and there's also been almost no retail interest either on Reddit or Twitter. I see a few reasons for that - market cap rules, the ticker change creates a delay in data for stock screeners to start finding it, and there have been plenty of other exciting meme trades over the last week. To me that means we're looking at smart money accumulating options with the intention of driving a gamma squeeze. Once retail catches on, they'll maintain the momentum and be left holding the bag.

Let's do a deeper dive on what these calls represent relative to the float. I've looked at September calls only and pulled the latest O.I from C.B.O.E. That data is below.

Remember that puts have the exact opposite hedging behavior as calls, so I've netted them out and included their impact on gamma as well. Currently, 31% of the float is tied up hedging these long calls. On top of that, a $1 increase in the underlying price will drive net buying of \~11% of the float in order to maintain delta-neutrality. In addition, gamma will increase and the net hedging will accelerate as the $17.5 and $20 strikes get closer to in the money. This gives us a price around $17 where there aren't enough shares to hedge the outstanding pool of call options and we get a gamma squeeze.

Conversely, this option pricing effect can be just as dramatic on the downside as the upside. If the price falls below $10, expect most of the 400k shares represented by the $12.5 strikes to add to selling pressure.

There is one major assumption we're making here - that all these trades are unilateral with the market maker and the market maker is taking the short side of that trade. That's almost certainly not true, but I believe it's fair to assume the majority are.

In summary, I *think* we are watching one or more hedge funds set up for a dramatic spike in share price caused by market dynamics. Similarly, I think now is the time to invest alongside them to get a quick 4-5x return. I view this as extremely speculative, so I've only got \~$2k of exposure in $20 strike September calls, but I may increase that in the coming days.

I'll end with a request. If you have information that disproves this thesis please share it. I have been looking for contradictory evidence, but have found very little.

Edit:

From their latest 8-K filed today. Post merger, there were 84,423,567 shares outstanding. 66,160,197 are subject to a lockup. 12,500,000 were PIPE shares that are not yet registered and not yet tradable, and 3.2M shares that are locked up except for charitable donations. The exact numbers are below.

The next shares that are expected to be tradable are the 1,078,125 incentive shares that are awarded to legacy shareholders if the stock price exceeds $13 for 10 consecutive days. The earliest that could be is September 9th. If this goes off, it will be before the 9th.

Edit #2:

I'm now fairly confident the incentive shares are subject to the lockup, so until registration of the PIPE shares, we're looking at 2.5M float plus whatever has been gifted to charity. Warrants can't convert for another 30 days, so those are also not a threat at the moment.""

This week I may have found the BEST play I have EVER FOUND! IronNet is set up perfectly to turn that tiny dong of yours into an IRON-hard MASSIVE green cock!

At first I was skeptical of this play because most ‘squeeze’ plays are shitty P&amp;D’s… but the more I looked into IRNT, the more I realised that this is a legitimate play which has the potential to 5X or MORE

Let me explain…  


**Low Float:**

IRNT technically has a float of 84.4m, but because it was recently a SP\*AC merger, any shares held by DFNS (the SP\*AC) or insiders are locked up for the next few months…

This means in reality ONLY 5.76M shares are able to physically be sold and ONLY 2.528M can be traded!   


https://preview.redd.it/ycs9ilbg2hn71.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbf699d1ad5889fc20cdbc0bf6a250e9413e9ee3

 Additionally, because of the lock-up agreement, IRNT is unable to issue ANY additional shares so there is no way they can increase the float

What this means is any options/shares you purchase will have a MUCH larger impact on the stock price

A low float also makes gamma squeezes WAY more likely because every share an MM purchases to delta hedge and/or sell a call is a larger percentage of the overall float

If the ITM open interest exceeds the amount of available shares, MM's are LITERALLY unable to get enough shares to cover their side of the transaction which will send this to the FUCKING MOON  


**Options:**

Now here is where it gets interesting...

On its own IRNT’s open interest is crazy, but once you factor in the tradable float you start to realise how fucking high this stock could go  


https://preview.redd.it/9s5vq0rj2hn71.png?width=319&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d70922f5f75c7c85b047433738fd3ca871913645

 IRNT has 44,434 calls expiring on 9/17 with many already being ITM. This means that up to 4.4M shares will be locked in these contracts

This is INSANE! Literally 2X the tradable float! And unlike short sellers, MM’s need to buy all these shares by a set deadline. This means that 4.4M shares will need to be purchased and all locked up at THE SAME TIME  
It is physically IMPOSSIBLE for MM’s to get enough shares for the 9/17 expiry because there literally aren’t EVEN enough tradable shares in existence

And unlike GME or AMC, IRNT is unable to issue ANY new shares

I don’t even know how options sellers will survive this… All I know is that I am going to get FUCKING RICH  


**Positions:**

5 $19 C 9/17, $20 C 9/17, 3 $21 C 9/17, 3 $22.5 C 9/17, 10 $24 C 9/17

**$IRNT** \- IronNet Cyber Security - an actual gamma squeeze candidate?

None of the subs I'm active on will take a post on this one since the market cap is too low. I've got to share it with someone, so the 57 of you following me directly may or may not see this.

To start with, I am super skeptical of anything that mentions the word ""squeeze."" Post-GME, it became a way to lure in suckers to be holding the dump after your pump. However, either this is going to be an honest to God gamma squeeze, or I've missed something big time.

Here's the background. DFNS, a pretty good SPAC sponsor actually, acquired IronNet Cyber Security. However, 90% of the shares were redeemed last week. This brought the total float down to 1.2M shares. In addition, 1.5M shares from management were unlocked, giving us a total 2.7M shares available to trade.

Usually, options trading requires a much higher float than this. The CBOE requires a 7M share float (technically, 7M shares owned by holders without reporting requirements), and 2.4M shares traded in the last 12 months before allowing options trading. $IRNT is far below that, but before redemptions DFNS wasn't. This has created a bit of a hole in the CBOE liquidity rulebook.

What does that mean for us? Well, there are a huge number of options being traded and a huge OI growing by the day. There are something like 40k total call options outstanding and more than 30k in September expiries alone, and there's also been almost no retail interest either on Reddit or Twitter. I see a few reasons for that - market cap rules, the ticker change creates a delay in data for stock screeners to start finding it, and there have been plenty of other exciting meme trades over the last week. To me that means we're looking at smart money accumulating options with the intention of driving a gamma squeeze. Once retail catches on, they'll maintain the momentum and be left holding the bag.

Let's do a deeper dive on what these calls represent relative to the float. I've looked at September calls only and pulled the latest OI from CBOE. That data is below.

[https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9](https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9)

Remember that puts have the exact opposite hedging behavior as calls, so I've netted them out and included their impact on gamma as well. Currently, 31% of the float is tied up hedging these long calls. On top of that, a $1 increase in the underlying price will drive net buying of \~11% of the float in order to maintain delta-neutrality. In addition, gamma will increase and the net hedging will accelerate as the $17.5 and $20 strikes get closer to in the money. This gives us a price around $17 where there aren't enough shares to hedge the outstanding pool of call options and we get a gamma squeeze.

Conversely, this option pricing effect can be just as dramatic on the downside as the upside. If the price falls below $10, expect most of the 400k shares represented by the $12.5 strikes to add to selling pressure.

There is one major assumption we're making here - that all these trades are unilateral with the market maker and the market maker is taking the short side of that trade. That's almost certainly not true, but I believe it's fair to assume the majority are.

In summary, I \*think\* we are watching one or more hedge funds set up for a dramatic spike in share price caused by market dynamics. Similarly, I think now is the time to invest alongside them to get a quick 4-5x return. I view this as extremely speculative, so I've only got \~$2k of exposure in $20 strike September calls, but I may increase that in the coming days.

I'll end with a request. If you have information that disproves this thesis please share it. I have been looking for contradictory evidence, but have found very little.

This week I may have found the BEST play I have EVER FOUND! IronNet is set up perfectly to turn that tiny dong of yours into an IRON-hard MASSIVE green cock!

At first I was skeptical of this play because most ‘squeeze’ plays are shitty P&amp;D’s… but the more I looked into IRNT, the more I realised that this is a legitimate play which has the potential to 5X or MORE

Let me explain…  


**Low Float:**

IRNT technically has a float of 84.4m, but because it was recently a SPAC merger, any shares held by DFNS (the SPAC) or insiders are locked up for the next few months…

This means in reality ONLY 5.76M shares are able to physically be sold and ONLY 2.528M can be traded!   


https://preview.redd.it/rai2oe4x0hn71.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eae2417e783feea62e053312b2462d8a142e183

Additionally, because of the lock-up agreement, IRNT is unable to issue ANY additional shares so there is no way they can increase the float

What this means is any options/shares you purchase will have a MUCH larger impact on the stock price

A low float also makes gamma squeezes WAY more likely because every share an MM purchases to delta hedge and/or sell a call is a larger percentage of the overall float

If the ITM open interest exceeds the amount of available shares, MM's are LITERALLY unable to get enough shares to cover their side of the transaction which will send this to the FUCKING MOON  


**Options:**

Now here is where it gets interesting...

On its own IRNT’s open interest is crazy, but once you factor in the tradable float you start to realise how fucking high this stock could go  


[ ](https://preview.redd.it/016zp2p31hn71.png?width=319&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6482e45ee9af8282098d64b1ba5383410e986a3)

IRNT has 44,434 calls expiring on 9/17 with many already being ITM. This means that up to 4.4M shares will be locked in these contracts

This is INSANE! Literally 2X the tradable float! And unlike short sellers, MM’s need to buy all these shares by a set deadline. This means that 4.4M shares will need to be purchased and all locked up at THE SAME TIME  
It is physically IMPOSSIBLE for MM’s to get enough shares for the 9/17 expiry because there literally aren’t EVEN enough tradable shares in existence

And unlike GME or AMC, IRNT is unable to issue ANY new shares

I don’t even know how options sellers will survive this… All I know is that I am going to get FUCKING RICH  


**Positions:**

5 $19 C 9/17, $20 C 9/17, 3 $21 C 9/17, 3 $22.5 C 9/17, 10 $24 C 9/17   


**TLDR:**

The physical trusts offered by Sprott are closed-end funds, meaning that when investors sell the fund, Sprott does not have to go out and also sell Uranium to fund outflows.

In other words, once uranium hits the Sprott vaults, it might as well be declared retired forever. 

They are structurally diamond handed, which is important for a short squeeze to continue.

So how does more metal enter the fund?

Sprott has filed an ‘at the money’ share offering where they can issue new shares of the fund any time it trades at a premium to the fund’s net asset value.

Essentially whenever investors get excited and bid up the price of the ETF such that that shares are being bought for more than their underlying value, Sprott will issue new shares, sell them into the market (which helps bring down the premium), and then use this cash to buy more uranium for the fund.

In the span of a month investors already added enough uranium to the fund to exhaust Sprott’s $300 million offering.

Last week they filed a new offering to increase it from a $300 million program, to a $1,300 million ($1.3 billion) program.

While this filing process has been ongoing the past few days, Sprott has not been issuing new shares. So inflows into the fund are driving up the premium to NAV.

The premium now sits at a record high 28.5%.

For perspective, during the Uranium surge that took price from the $20s to the $40s over the past month, the typical premium for the fund was in the mid single digit %s.

So 28.5% is absolutely remarkable. This is a dam about to break and drown everyone who lives on the other side. Once Sprott is able to issue shares once again, it will now be able to buy more uranium out of the market than anyone thought possible. $180-$200 is entirely possible here as a blow off top (currently at $45 a pound).

And this is a minuscule market, so sprott’s buying directly drives the price up. And because market participants know the price of uranium is effectively guaranteed to rise because of this guaranteed source of pent up demand, they are are willing to pay for the premium in the uranium fund to get a piece of the action. 

This of course only drives the premium of the fund up further, allowing Sprott to issue even more shares, buy even more uranium, sending the uranium price up further, exciting more investors who will buy the fund, and the cycle repeats 

This is effectively a short squeeze where the buying is being telegraphed ahead of time. Don’t get me wrong, the short squeeze has begun, but buying here is the equivalent of buying GME a when it was in the $50-$100 range on the initial surge.

So what tickers can be offered up here? 

Not many, because the uranium space is tiny and WSB has a $1.5 billion market cap minimum.

Options? You can, but premiums are absurd now that the squeeze has already begun.

$CCJ is one ticker you’ve likely heard of, and it’s the only one with mkt cap large enough to mention directly.  

Sprott Uranium Trust is the vehicle I’ve written about here where you can buy uranium directly (rather than miners), and directly contribute to the squeeze, but I also can’t post the ticker yet due to mkt cap concerns. It’s also only available in Canadian and otc markets, but Sprott is trying to get it listed on the NYSE as well for the future. You can buy it via Fidelity and a few other brokers right now though. 

Northshore uranium etf has lots of miners in it but a mkt cap of $350m so no ticker

Want to sell shovels rather than set out on a mining adventure yourself? Sprott the company owns the uranium trust driving this whole thing and collects fees from it. Benefiting from the inflows into the fund as well as the underlying price appreciation of uranium.  They also have direct exposure to several uranium miners they’ve invested in. They also aren’t big enough yet at $1 billion to post the ticker.

This uranium short squeeze, powered by the Sprott physical trust is everything the silver squeeze should and could have been back in the first quarter.  If silver squeezers had bought the Sprott physical fund, PSLV, rather than ishares SLV, silver would be far higher now. Let this be an example of what’s possible in commodities when physical demand overwhelms a relatively limited supply of available metal!",True,False,False,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,10830748,public,confidence,self,The Sprott Uranium fund is a self reinforcing buying machine that will propel it to stratospheric heights,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnyso1/the_sprott_uranium_fund_is_a_self_reinforcing/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yolo'd 384k bet into Uranium stocks over 12 months ago. Went all in at once which was a mistake at the time and cost me the capital commitment and the opportunity to be part of the GME shit show. But finally, the bet is starting to pay off and rip hard due to Sprott coming into the uranium market and purposely buying and driving up the spot price. Up 85k in two days. Uranium spot is at $40 a pound right now..... want to see it run to $200! Not a short squeeze play but a very very undervalued market.

Had to remove portfolio movers because some of the stocks are below $1 still. Sorry.

&gt;Merger announced today !  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&lt;Link to investor PDF -- check the original link, can't post the asset in this post&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Deck looks awesome. Metrics are better than Lemonade.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Led by David Friedberg [https://twitter.com/friedberg](https://twitter.com/friedberg?lang=en)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
PIPE led by Chamath (SPCE and MP guy) and Mark Cuban

This DD is much better because it includes a link to Metromile's investor presentation, which means you can trust it 100%. How was the stock done since? It's quartered in value. gg.

10 months ago: [metromile\_inaq\_starting\_to\_take\_off\_already](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0hvv3/metromile_inaq_starting_to_take_off_already/)

&gt;It's no EV company, but another SPAC that started trading today. Metromile only currently operates in 8 states with a high ceiling to expand to rest of the states. Already up \~12% AH, get in quick!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
edit: 14% now.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Positions: 10,000 shares @ 11.20. Planning to grab more shares tomorrow before Mark Cuban, Chamath, the rest of the world catches on.

10,000 shares @ 11.20 means this clown has lost $69K. First clear buying signal that I've seen.

&gt;Background of company: An insurtech company dealing with car insurance. Different from all other insurance companies in the space because they do insurance based on how much you drive.   
&gt;  
&gt;So people that drive less than 12,000 miles a year would save money using this. Great for high populated areas such as New York and San Fran.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
They are currently only running in 8 states so a huge growth opportunity when they expand. They have been beaten down a lot with this sell off and are below SPAC offering.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Revenue and Competition: Their market cap is getting close to 1 billion with over 100 mill in revenue. Compare it to their competitor Lemonade which does different types of insurance they have comparable revenue and growth but LMND market cap is 5 times that of Metro but Metro has more room to grow cause of the expansion of their market which is 42 more states and possibly out of the country.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
They also have a deal with Ford on new vehicles that they signed last year in December to help get their name out their and their tech is actually pretty good.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
They are also a SaaS company that can sell their tech to other insurance companies to use with the basis of tracking miles and calculating your insurance that way.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
They are beat down just like their competitors LMND and Root but are way undervalued compared to them with way more growth opportunities and are different than any other insurance company.

Beaten down at the sell off **SIX MONTHS AGO**, when the stock fell from $20\~ to under $10. I would agree that the stock is undervalued compared to competitors... and guess what the price is as I type? That's right, $4.20. This is the 2nd best DD but didn't include any rocket emoji so definitely worst DD I've ever seen.

I've been following $IRNT since the post market jump when it went from $16 to $40 in AH. It had seemingly been written off despite the fact that it's been primed for a gamma squeeze at almost every moment since it came down from that run to $40. To be clear, this is a real gamma squeeze, not a meme-y play. This is a rare situation and that's why I'm calling attention to it.

The setup is simple:

1. The float is currently 1.3M shares due to SPAC redemptions &amp; lockups and will be at this number until after options expiry on Sep 17th.
2. It has options, which usually are only available for stocks over 7M float
3. Almost 200% of those 1.3M shares are claimed by the already ITM open interest on the call options. This means that the squeeze has ALREADY been set in motion and you're just waiting for time to draw closer to expiration. The movement we saw Friday is what we refer to as a ""pre-squeeze"" movement, there is likely far more to come.
4. On Friday the $20 strike became ITM and instantly doubled the amount of the float that is claimed by the open interest.
5. As of this morning ORTEX shows 4.3M shares shorted which amounts to 336% SI with a cost to borrow of 628% on average. I have doubts about the accuracy of this specific data because that would put the amount of the float claimed by institutional obligations nearing 600%, so I'll stick with saying that the last reliable data seemingly had SI at around 13% with the same elevated cost to borrow.

If $IRNT runs, it could potentially be the first true infinity squeeze since VW and has the potential to beat the heights of $ORGO &amp; $GME.

$IRNT will very likely start running some time before expiration on Sep 17th. It could be today, it could be Thursday, but at some point, the buy volume will likely come in and the IV on the options will spike to crazy heights almost instantly.

Be warned, this play is incredible risky, if you choose to partake only do so with money you can afford to lose.

When I was a boy ~~in Bulgaria~~ I remember foundly of our little SEARS store. This wasn't even your typical store, it was this tiny place where they kept some inventory (mainly washer/dryer sets) but mainly you went there to order shit. Pre-internet days obviously, this was in the 90s for five snakes. The store owners were obviously bullish on SEARS like why open one in a village anyway (town of less than 5k) ? I remember every year getting the SEARS catalog, holy fuck what a blast to the past. I would blast through the thousands of fucking pages looking at all the items just imagining what it would be like to have some of these as gifts.. air hockey table.. trampolines.. those were the days.

Enter the 21st century and where the fuck is my SEARS? It's been shorted into oblivion. Bastards. Brick and mortar stores are dead huh? Amazon getting set to open stores? Strange. Something smells of fuckery.

More like a Triangle of Fuckery.

Mitt Romney + Bezos + Citadel = 180 degrees of absolute putrid, shameless, fuckery.

The apes know and will make you pay, even if the system and its 'regulators' refuse to do so. You've fucked the wrong monkey, and it's not AIDS you're getting this time.

How the? What the? Is it a surprise these shorts were never closed? No, because then they would have to pay taxes... The goal is to \*never close the short position... ever\*

The DD has already been done, we may see companies that have been blast-fucked by shorts rise from the dead as if this is some zombie-company apocalypse. If GME squeezes, we might be in for other surprises along the way so I'm picking some SEARS up for my childhood sake.

If you're already cock-balls-taint-deep and you have only a few dollars to spend on cardboard box rent, fuck that and spend it on some SHLDQ. When I bought my shares today I had a message popup saying a bunch of shit I didn't understand so I pressed ok and bought at asking, can't believe people were putting up bids rofl.

Right now this subs seems to just be on the path to become a big mainstream central discussion forum for young traders, and it's natural given its size. The model will probably stay the same for a long time: we get jall acked on a random meme stock, we pump it collectively, people who got in early make some, people who got in late lose some. But what differentiates r/wallstreetbets from other subs mentioned above is that there is still a minimal dose of self awareness and collective intelligence -at least in some- underneath all the gambling and shitposting.

However, occasionally this forum goes through days like today when this GME delusion emerges again and people talk about it here.

BABA: WSB has been screaming by the dip on BABA as one of the most under-valued stocks of all time. For what it's worth (literally useless info) I am also long BABA.

SOFI: This stock is slowly becoming one of WSB's favorites. Not sure why, but my guess is the recent drop from $25 to $15 has some autistos buying the dip.

GME: No need for an explanation on this one.

SPCE: News about Virgin Galactic probe is affecting the stock price, now down 3%. Will Branson's SPCE return to space? I'm not sure but he should send his next jet to space full of virgin's as a sacrifice and also as a marketing tactic.

Times are tough, and well, this is Nebraska, where money is a rare commodity. Ever since the pandemic started, we have seen a surge of orphans come to us. We didn’t know what to do. Sharon, bless her soul, at the start of the pandemic, started working behind a Wendy's dumpster to do things we pray the Lord will forgive her for. Bradly asked his wife’s boyfriend for a larger allowance. Despite this, we felt like we were going to let all these children down. Have you ever seen an orphan cry? It is so draining.           
       Then on a magical day, I was logged onto my Robinhood account and left to use the restroom to cry. While I was crying, this godsend four-year-old named Sasha bought one hundred GME calls. At first I was livid, but the next day GME mooned to $70, and like a paper-handed bitch I sold all the calls. I felt like I let down our 69 orphans, but Sasha and her friends told me they bought puts on Sharon’s account. I couldn’t believe that these little kids were geniuses with options.             
       So from that day, we have these kids working and making only options trades from open to close. Things were going amazing till we got a six-year-old dropped off this week. His father said he couldn’t trade options for his life. Well, we should had believed him.  Instead we let this demon spawn trade. What is the first trade he makes? He bought 1,000 CHWY calls for $300 that expire next week. He said it was an accident, and he meant to buy 300 calls for $1,000 for next week. He said earnings would be lit, and a little nudge would make our accounts moon. Not to mention the BABA calls he made were too ugly even to speak.           
       This kid has been here less than a week and is already beyond saving. He will be a burden to us, and no one will want to adopt a kid that can’t trade. I have to leave him with the meth heads before he ruins everything I worked for.

Hey all, been hanging around here and reading up the DD's and whatnot since things got hot back in Jan. Figured I'd take my first shot at actually tearing into a chart and looking for some trend stuff in the event the MOASS isn't right around the corner. Really just throwing this out there for criticism and to see how it compares to the actual movement in the next couple trading days. Since I know nothing at all I'm labeling this discussion and an uninformed one at that, but we all gotta start somewhere. Again, I know nothing, this is not advice, and even if it was it would probably be pretty bad.

&amp;#x200B;

So as shown in my crude little draw up, GME is trading in the converging triangle generated by the top of the initial squeeze in January and the bottom of the subsequent drop. The previous two runups capped at right around $350 and $345. If the prediction is made based on the triangle, we would likely see a rise to around $245 in the next three trading days. If the prediction is made based on the trend of the last two rises, the ceiling would occur around $340 within the next three trading days.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, as we all know earnings is fast approaching after the long weekend. In each of the past three earnings reports, GME has taken an average hit the following day of 26.8%. For the chart I added lines showing a 25% drop from each of the ceilings which seems like a reasonable guess weighing the average drop with the likelihood of a solid earnings report. In the event of a fall from the higher ceiling of $340, the price would come to rest at the following close around $255. This is outside the triangle from the initial squeeze, and could possibly signal the start of another run up. In the other case, the fall from $245 to $183 would keep GME above the floor from the initial drop, and we would look for the next movement point at the convergence later in September.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this is my first crack at chart work, so I'd love and feedback or criticisms or whatever anyone with more or less wrinkles has to say on all this. If it's totally wrong, at least the colors are pretty. If it's right, maybe I can finally move out of the closet in the basement and into a closet on the first floor.

I follow high short interest companies to try and find some gold in a mountain of turds and think I found one. After reviewing their [10-Q and 8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-040716/) I think Big 5 has a promising case for a continued value play despite their 40% growth over the past two weeks especially considering their P/E ratio of 6.87 is well below dicks sporting goods (12.13) and academy sports and outdoor (8.25). They also currently sit at a 38% short interest, 20 million in float, and 22 in shares outstanding leading to a potential situation where shorts may need to cover leading to a short term increase in price (not the next GME you apes). I figure [BGFV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BGFV/) would still be a solid buy in the $29-$32 price range and can easily see a price target of $41 by EOY.

**Background on Big 5 (BGFV):** 

Big 5 Sporting Goods Corp is a specialty retailer company that is principally engaged in the sale of sporting goods in the western United States. Its product mix includes athletic shoes, apparel, and accessories, as well as a broad selection of outdoor and athletic equipment for team sports, fitness, camping, hunting, fishing, tennis, golf, winter and summer recreation and roller sports. The company operates solely as a sporting goods retailer, which includes both retail stores and an e-commerce platform. The company operates a distribution center located in Riverside, California, that services all of its stores and e-commerce platform.

**BIG 5 SPORTING GOODS CORPORATION FISCAL 2021 2Q results:**

**-**Achieved Record Quarterly Sales and Earnings Results

\-Same Store Sales Increased 31.2% in FY 2021 Second Quarter versus the High-End of Guidance of 27%

\-EPS of $1.63 for FY 2021 Second Quarter versus Guidance Range of $1.05 to $1.25

\-Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 39% to $0.25 per Share per quarter to an annual rate of $1.00 per share, which is their fourth dividend increase over the past four quarters.

\-generated record net income of $36.8 million with $88.7 million of operating cash flow in Q2

\-Adjusted EBITDA was $52.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and $83.2 million for the 26-week period ended July 4, 2021

**Pros:**

\-Strong sales and margins.

Despite cycling the peak of the 2020 COVID-19 related sales surge and being impacted by the widely reported supply chain disruptions and staffing challenges in the retail industry, they have continued to produce strong sales growth and margins versus historical pre-pandemic levels. 

\-Plans for (cautious but optimistic store growth)

The Company currently has 429 stores in operation, which reflects one store closure in the third quarter to date. Over the remainder of fiscal 2021, the Company expects to open approximately five stores and close approximately one store. This just shows a solid footing and plan for expansion and future growth.

\-fully paid off debt. 

with their favorable operating results throughout the remainder of fiscal 2020, they were able to fully repay their borrowings while increasing their levels of cash and cash equivalents, and their financial condition was further enhanced during the first half of fiscal 2021 via strong sales and operating cash flow for the period. As of July 4, 2021 and January 3, 2021, they had zero long-term revolving credit borrowings, compared to $35.0 million outstanding as of the second quarter ended June 28, 2020. 

\-lots of cash. 

As of July 4, 2021 and January 3, 2021,they had cash and cash equivalents of $118.9 million and $64.7 million, respectively, compared to cash of $16.7 million as of June 28, 2020.

**Potential cons/risks to value of stock:**

\-Potential meh 3rd and 4th quarter. 

Fiscal 2021 third quarter guidance reflects anticipated continued impacts related to the widely reported supply chain disruptions and staffing challenges in the retail industry, plus an unfavorable shift in fiscal calendar. For the fiscal 2021 third quarter, the Company expects same store sales in the flat to positive mid-single digit range and expects to realize earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.95 to $1.15. This compares to a same store sales increase of 14.8% and earnings per diluted share of $1.31 in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which at the time were the highest sales and earnings of any quarter in the company’s history. For the third quarter of fiscal 2019, earnings per diluted share were $0.30. Additionally, guidance relative to the prior year period reflects the unfavorable impact of the fiscal calendar shift related to our 53-week fiscal 2020, which moved the Fourth of July holiday from the third quarter of fiscal 2020 into the second quarter of fiscal 2021. As a result, the third quarter of fiscal 2021 excludes the historically high-volume Fourth of July holiday week, which is replaced by an historically low-volume week in early October. As a result of this shift, the Company anticipates an approximately $0.20 unfavorable impact to diluted earnings per share for the third quarter. This calendar shift does not impact the Company’s same store sales calculation, which is measured on a comparable-week basis. 

\-Heavily focused around California. 

The Company primarily operates traditional sporting goods retail stores located in the western United States, with approximately 52% of its stores, along with its corporate offices and distribution center, located in California. Because of this, the Company is subject to regional risks, including the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. 

\-Risks of having many suppliers and the shift to e-commerce (Nike especially)

The Company purchases merchandise from over 680 suppliers, and the Company’s 20 largest suppliers accounted for 36.4% of total purchases in fiscal 2020. One vendor, Nike, represented greater than 5% of total purchases, at 8.5%, in fiscal 2020 and accounted for 7.2% of the Company’s total sales in fiscal 2020. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company was informed of an expansion of Nike’s direct-to-consumer initiatives that will impact certain multi-branded retailers, including the Company, and which will lead to a significant reduction in the Company’s future supply chain relative to this vendor. This transition is not expected to impact the Company’s ability to continue to purchase certain Nike branded products from authorized licensees. The Company is actively expanding its relationships with other new and existing vendors in order to replace the affected Nike product within its product mix.

\-Costs may rise

Merchandise margins, which exclude buying, occupancy and distribution expense, increased by a favorable 380 basis points compared with the second quarter of last year when merchandise margins increased by a favorable 173 basis points. The increase primarily reflects lower promotional activities, a shift in our product sales mix and higher sales prices in response to increases in product purchase costs. The higher product purchase costs we are experiencing reflect increased raw material, labor and freight costs initially resulting from shortages related to COVID-19, as well as strong consumer demand. Shipping capacity constraints are also contributing to higher freight costs and are adversely impacting our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of certain products to meet the higher demand.

\-California minimum wage hike will increase labor expenses going forward

They estimate that the impact of the California state-wide minimum wage rate increase, combined with the impact of the additional minimum wage rate increases in certain other jurisdictions within California and other states, caused their labor expense to increase by approximately $0.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

Position: 3 shares at $28.38, hoping to buy another $1000 in shares in the 29$-30$ share price range in the coming week and $300 in poor mans covered calls with the long leg expiring in April 2022. will buy $2,000 more if the stock drops below $28.

No matter what the technicals say, no matter how much they ascended they just can't let go and move on to another candidate that has more potential. I'm a seasoned investor and I highly suggest you look at FUBO. Technically it has formed a base and looks like it wants to run higher and from what I gather 20% of the float is shorted. Beyond that the company is growing faster than any other streaming service on the planet and that's no pumping. It has so many catysts fundamentally with the subscriber growth, ad growth and sports book potential which should be rolled out soon. Here is a fact.....they are the only sports centric streaming service and they will be the only ones that will both be the streaming service and sports book. We all know that betting is exploding as state by state surrenders and allows gambling and in the end bettors will want to watch the game and bet on that game on that streaming service. That is the ideal setup and neither Fanduel or Draftkings can do that. They also will own all of the analytics and user data of their subscribers to be able to tailor their marketing. The other betting sites which are doing partnerships with content providers won't own that data and the content providers won't share that data with the betting sites. They are very reluctant to share that data so that's another competitive advantage for Fubo. I think Fubo could offer reduced fees or free fees for bettors who do so much wagering and what bettor wouldn't want to have a free service to do their betting on? I can tell you that the betting sites that are forced to sign with content providers will definitely be paying a fee for that partnership or they will be forced to share their betting profits with that provider. Fubo will in essence have that vertical.integration that others just won't have. It's such a juicy company long term and at the same time has that squeeze potential. Have no.idea why GME or AMC lovers continue to be long there when they already have had runs that far outweigh what they are worth.

A gamma squeeze occurs when there is a significant interest in shares under OTM call options. Market makers or hedge funds want to sell these options and expect to receive a premium for the selling. Me, as a call option buyer, have a clearly defined maximum loss and unlimited profit. However, as a seller (market maker, hedge fund, institution) of a call option, has a set maximum profit but the potential loss is unlimited. He doesn’t want to take on that much risk. Therefore, he hedges against this risk by buying shares. If the number of OTM options demanded in the markets increases, this requires MM to buy more shares to hedge against this risk.  
Why Gamma? It is necessary to understand the principle of options and the Greek letters Delta and Gamma. Delta measures the sensitivity of the option price to movements in the underlying stock and shows how the value of the option will change if the stock price will change by $1. Gamma show us how the value of Delta will change when the price of the underlying stock increases by $1. As the option gets closer ITM, Delta increases and Gamma changes too. Every time the share price increases, Delta increases and market maker has to buy more shares again depending on the size of Delta. For example, if the Delta is 0.45 then for every option sold (100 shares) MM needs to buy 45 shares to hedge the risk. If the value of the stock increases by $1, then Gamma changes the Delta to 0.6 and MM have to buy 60 shares per call option to reduce risk. This creates a spiral that keeps pushing the share and option price up.  
There has been a recent Gamma squeeze on GME, AMC, etc. and occasionally there will be other Gamma squeeze opportunities.

I have counted all the call options vs put options and it is a very bullish view.

[ Written calls vs puts](https://preview.redd.it/uvznj8c0x1l71.png?width=538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fe55f7c049005110a710b069edf5a85b5446896)

 Let's take a look at the open interest call options currently expiring on September and November. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/drzkpx03x1l71.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5a1fbaaf675fff9982e3942bbd0cc96f6a8fc0c)

Currently, the open interest for call options up to the $12.5 strike is over **25.922** and that means almost **2.6 Million** shares in call options.

At the squeeze in April 2021, the call option open interest was only **9,500**.

An important part of every squeeze is the catalyst.  
Here will be just such a catalyst in a few weeks and not just one but at least three:

* Chairman of the 180 Life Sciences Clinical Advisory Board, Professor Jagdeep Nanchahal, has Been Invited To [Present a Keynote Talk at the British Society for Surgery of the Hand](https://ir.180lifesciences.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/41/chairman-of-the-180-life-sciences-clinical-advisory-board).
*  Phase 2 of the Frozen shoulder will start during Q3.

*  Phase 3 Dupuytren's Disease results are announced for Q4.

Is it possible gamma squeeze here? In my opinion, definitely yes.

What shouldn't you miss? Read this week's [letter to shareholders from CEO Dr. Jim Woody](https://ir.180lifesciences.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/44/180-life-sciences-corp-ceo-james-woody-md-phd-issues).

I've been watching $GME like a hawk all week and the correlation between volume and price for the past week is incredible and to me seems very, very bullish. Check it out:

August 26th at open: Spikes on high volume (889k shares in first hour, goes up $10). It waffles for a bit  as volume declines and hits its daily peak at $217 on 851k shares. Volume drops like a rock for the rest of the day and it sinks back down to $203.80 at close.

August 27th: Jumps from $207 to $213 at open, volume goes down then back up over the course of the day and the price kinda waffles. This one doesn't follow the trend so well. The next day does, however

August 30th: Jumps from $206 to $215 in the first hour on high volume (547k shares). Volume declines for the rest of the day and it drops again

August 31st: Jumps about $6 in the first 2 hours on high volume (315k first hour, 729k second).

Sept 1st (Today): Jumps to hit its weekly peak of $231 at open on its **highest one-hour volume all week**, with 1.09M shares traded in the first hour. It then spends the rest of the day tanking on decreasing volume.

Is it just me or does this seem incredibly bullish? It seems if we had a sustained high volume event we could see this stock rocket. Fortunately we probably do, as Sept 6-8th are the 3 days before earnings. Once this thing hits WSB and news outlets consistently we could easily be riding the rocket. Also because you're all brain damaged, this isn't financial advice.

As a side note: comparing this to $AMC is pretty funny. It literally tanks on some of its recent volume spikes. Biggest P&amp;D of this week and stands no chance to keep going up.

I'm fairly certain they believe their position is safe here simply because retail doesn't give a flying fuck about the stock. Lets change that.

Couple that with diversifying into Weed delivery, Blockchain payments and a new deliver anything model, this stock could be valued at 15x like $DASH and be trading at nearly $20 a share. That's just fair value. With a squeeze... we could see 100. 1 to 100. I do hold a position, piddly winks compared to most folks. That being said, I'm all in and there simply isn't the retail demand to send the volume this needs to force them to cover. With your guys help, maybe we can change that. I'm sick of watching a company that is doing great things for the Southern community while expanding nationally be shorted to nearly nothing. I want revenge, and damn it if you get in now you can get revenge with the rest of the Waitards. Do your worst WSB.

In all likelihood the bot is going to remove this post immediately. IDGAF, I want yall to know I'm balls deep in a stock that has ate my lunch. We need you WSB. You're our only hope.

While my Gain/Loss looks alright what it doesn't show is me chasing this stock all the way down from 5. My losses here are substantial and this is the last account I have left. Like I said, small position. But this is all I got left.

Now I get that you guys can view this as a distraction from the real battles at AMC &amp; GME, as well as some of these newer meme stocks, but if Citadel is sent into margin call they're going to be forced to cover their shorts everywhere. A short squeeze here causes a domino effect over all the stocks they are shorting. I'm fairly certain they believe their position is safe here simply because retail doesn't give a flying fuck about the stock. Lets change that.

&amp;#x200B;

The stock is \*\*$WTRH\*\*. Does it have a $1.5B market cap? Not currently. But it should with the fundamentals. The company is trading under its annual revenue. Highway robbery. Couple that with diversifying into Weed delivery, Blockchain payments and a new deliver anything model, this stock could be valued at 15x like $DASH and be trading at nearly $20 a share. That's just fair value. With a squeeze... we could see 100. 1 to 100. I do hold a position, piddly winks compared to most folks. That being said, I'm all in and there simply isn't the retail demand to send the volume this needs to force them to cover. With your guys help, maybe we can change that. I'm sick of watching a company that is doing great things for the Southern community while expanding nationally be shorted to nearly nothing. I want revenge, and damn it if you get in now you can get revenge with the rest of the Waitards. Do your worst WSB.

Any how is so funny to see the rest of the world catching up to what a group of crayon sniffing apes have been openly discussing for almost a year.  While the same folks were playing the redirect, social manipulation/ engineering game with the masses.

I'm so excited to see what everyone does to help change the world for better. My family already does so much with refugees, 3rd world country primary schools, orphanages, drug and alcohol abuse/ addiction. Always wondered how much more I could do if I had money like those guys.

Furthermore, we can observe a bullish crossover on the ""Moving Average Convergence Divergence"" (MACD) indicator happening **right now**.
This usually increases the buy pressure, since most of the market is traded by bots that act on these inputs.

These staffing shortages came on recently due to so many free handouts that the lazy employees don't feel like working. When real Americans were true and proud, work was good and I got to yell at the workers and they couldn't do shit about it. And now free money has them lazy.

Go ahead and remove my post but I say short these companies now because when I finally did get my sandwich I'm pretty sure it did have bourbon in it so now I went to the liquor store and bought a handle of Jack Daniels and am so enraged I might call corporate on my land line to complain. I might even sue them.

Before I call I'm going to get good and gacked out so they can feel my rage through the phone. These fucking lazy FUCKS!

Today I wanted to bring to your attention the MACD in general, using Wallstreets love/hate child, and my favorite stock, Gamestop $GME.  
   
**MACD: Moving Average Convergence Divergence :** Lemme break it down for you. You got two lines. One Blue(short term outlook) One Orange(Longer term outlook)When they cross or diverge significantly that can send a signal for a trader to enter or exit a trade. Here is an example from investopedia.  


 

[When the blue line\(short term sentiment\) crosses the long term a sell off is occurring. When the blue line crosses going upwards recent sentiment is bullish and generally lots of buying happens until they cross or get near again. How fast the blue line breaks away from the orange line determines how bullish or bearish recent sentiment is.\(The lines on the price chart are the 20 ema and Vwap I believe, investopedia has it unlabeled.\)](https://preview.redd.it/j271wzrywrk71.png?width=6146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e75d828f7da491436e692237af8f70da134fc8ec)

Now here is an example of the MACD  last time GME was at this level($210-220) before running to 350 in early June.   


[On the bottom you use a Green Donut. The outer crust of the donut shows a slight dip below long term sentiment before crossing again and taking off! The top donut shows the slight dip in price when macD crossed. Now lets compare to right now!](https://preview.redd.it/ncs9xqplxrk71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a652bf759d63144cff3bb4169c7430c89ca8497a)

&amp;#x200B;

[As you can see the blue line crossed the orange line downward and we had a small dip in price proceeding a strong close. If you see the blue line cross the orange line back upwards and break away prepare for a rip!](https://preview.redd.it/65myefeayrk71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1dc8efbcf7e38f299abd748d414df7bb1af8a05)

Above are the 30 minute time frames because they will be most applicable if you are looking to buy say tomorrow morningish. But here is the daily chart which paints a much clearer picture of buy and sell zones stricly using macD. Also will be comparing it to APPL.   


[Buy and sell zones for gme over the last 6 months just using MacD. The Daily MacD has not been this bullish for 3 months.](https://preview.redd.it/qvfp3q34rsk71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c823716cbebc3d91c5b8a54c2b841add085acf1)

&amp;#x200B;

[Appl for comparison. ](https://preview.redd.it/l24u2tcorsk71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c504f118d0b2ca30009306c7b5bf79a445490af7)

Lastly I just want to mention some other indicators you should look at/pay attention to as well. RSI, 50EMA, and Vwap. Here is an article to Benzinga that is bullish even though RSI is hot(anything above 50 or 60 depends who you talk to is overbought and below 50-40 is oversold.) [https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/08/22745579/why-gamestop-stock-looks-ready-to-break-out](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/08/22745579/why-gamestop-stock-looks-ready-to-break-out)  


TLDR: None of this is financial advice. When lines cross buy or sell. If you see the blue line cross the orange line upwards really fast within the next 16 days expect a rip to follow. If the blue line drops below the orange line fast a sell off is occurring. You can apply MacD to most stocks, but it is a lagging indicator and no technical indicator is perfect I recommend using multiple to reaffirm whatever your thesis is. BULLISH GME$$$  


Why 16 days? To rub my nutsack all over these guys faces, not because I hate them, but because I know they will enjoy it  when GME rips!!

But I’m gonna tell you about the real China play, one which sort of flies under the radar because it doesn’t have the same prominence as BABA or PDD or DIDI. It’s TIGR, or UP Fintech Holdings Limited. Known as ‘the Robinhood of China’, UP Fintech has a couple of significant differences to the platform we all love to hate (for one thing, they didn’t prevent users from buying GME). Let’s take a closer look.

**1.** **What’s UP, doc?**

UP Fintech is a brokerage offering an app and a desktop client/server platform. It’s mainly focused on Chinese investors, but the occasional gweilo like me is welcome as a customer, too. Apparently, there are over a billion Chinese in China alone, and countless others all over the world. While listed on the Nasdaq since 2019 (at an initial offering of US8), the Cayman Islands domiciled UP Fintech holding company has operating entities in Asia (including China), Oceania (that’s all the islands and nations surrounding the Eastern Pacific, including Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, etc). The company was founded in Beijing in 2014 and has its HQ-proper, there.

**2.** **The good: An excellent platform**

TIGR’s primary product is its trade platform, much ike Robinhood. TIGR’s trading platform is called Tiger Trade and consists of an app as well as a desktop client/server application, which work in concert. It provides options trading as well as the usual trading of stocks; unlike RH, TIGR offers access to global markets, so from a single app you can trade the Nasdaq, NYSE, OTCs, LSE, Hang Seng, the ASX, etc. This is a powerful feature as I am sure WSB degens will appreciate: why lose money for 8 hours a day when you can lose it around the clock!

Tiger Trade provides full access to markets, eg pre and post. Execution is excellent, the interface is very good on the app (although not quite RH good, particularly when it comes to options), and the platform is comprehensive, offering up to the minute charting, news, analysis, all SEC filings, company profiles and analyst price targets, in a single place. You get NYSE Arcabook standard and can buy additional data packages. It is gamified, like RH, incentivising trades and encouraging community engagement by awarding ‘Tiger Tokens’ for various actions, including making trades, as well as ‘social’ actions such as commenting, sharing positions, producing DDs, and so on. These tokens can be used to purchase various items including ‘Commission-free trade cards’.

Which brings us to another matter – the cost of trading on Tiger. Signup is free (in my country, NZ, at least – I don’t know if this is the case elsewhere). Typically, a trade will cost you .99c US, no matter the value of the trade. You can’t trade fractional shares. Tiger Trade also supports short selling for the brave or really foolish (like me).

**3.** **The bad: It’s an ADR. And some other stuff.**

Probably the biggest risk I see with TIGR is its status as an ADR. While TIGR hasn’t ‘enjoyed’ the scrutiny of the CCCP which has befallen BABA, BIDU, VIPS and especially the edus the tickers of which can no longer be mentioned on WSB, it is nevertheless joined at the hip with other Chinese ADRs. This means whether or not the CCCP has a blowtorch on TIGR specifically, it is subject to the same vagaries of a dictatorial party, ie there is political risk either directly or by association. This has, I think, underpinned recent volatility in the stock, which tends to move in lockstep with the other ADRs…China stocks up, TIGR stock up, and vice versa. It’s a China stock, what can I say.

There was also the issue, so to speak, of a share issue in June, where a further 6.5 million ADRs were issued. In a statement, the company said the proceeds are to go towards (i) expanding its customer base and driving customer engagement with its services, (ii) investing in expanding its products, services and technologies to enhance its user experience and operating efficiency, and (iii) expanding its international presence. Issues are never good for existing holders, but at least TIGR didn’t include the ‘general corporate purposes’ which invariably means ‘We need the money for rent and salaries’. The other thing is that the offering is complete, so there shouldn’t hopefully be any further dilution on the cards for now.

**4.** **The pretty: A growth story**

Let’s take a look at some numbers. The company is currently valued at around 2.4 billion and has around 800 employees (compare with RH with a valuation north of 16b, and around 1300 employees).

At the last quarter, TIGR published the following results:

· Total revenues increased 255.5% year-over-year to US$81.3 million.

· Total net revenues increased 245.7% year-over-year to US$75.7 million.

· Net income increased to US$21.1 million from net loss of US$0.5 million in the same quarter of last year.

· Net income attributable to UP Fintech increased to US$21.1 million from net loss of US$0.2 million in the same quarter of last year.

· Non-GAAP net income attributable to UP Fintech increased to US$23.5 million, compared to US$1.1 million in the same quarter of last year. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to the most comparable GAAP metrics is set forth below.

· Operating Highlights for First Quarter 2021

· Total account balance increased 289.8% year-over-year to US$21.4 billion.

· Total margin financing and securities lending balance increased 177.3% year-over-year to US$2.3 billion.

· Total number of customers **with deposits** increased 180.4% year-over-year to 376.0K.

Right now, TIGR is trading at a PE of about 52. There’s plenty of volume, with around 10 mil per day, so liquidity isn’t an issue.

After the publication of these results in May, the share price shot through the roof, going from around 17 to around 28 in a little over two weeks.

**5.** **Upcoming earnings**

TIGR reports on 10 September (pre). Given the rapid expansion of its customer numbers in the preceding quarter, and given the growing interest in easy-to-use, affordable trading platforms not only in the USA but everywhere (and the Chinese are everywhere, along with compliant gweilos like myself), I fully expect the customer growth numbers to shoot out the lights. That share issue described above may even prove a major catalyst in driving customer growth, after all, they completed the offering fast and have the money, let’s see how well they have invested it.

My expectation for earnings is a big boost in the share price. Right now, with the Chinese ADRs experiencing something of a comeback, I have a price target of at least $24. That’s solid upside from the current SP of around 13.70.

**Position:**

6982 shares at 14.56. Looking for any dips below 13 to add more.

Apparently, there are over a billion Chinese in China alone, and countless others all over the world. While listed on the Nasdaq since 2019 (at an initial offering of US8), the Cayman Islands domiciled UP Fintech holding company has operating entities in Asia (including China), Oceania (that’s all the islands and nations surrounding the Eastern Pacific, including Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, etc). The company was founded in Beijing in 2014 and has its HQ-proper, there.

**2.** **The good: An excellent platform**

TIGR’s primary product is its trade platform, much ike Robinhood. TIGR’s trading platform is called Tiger Trade and consists of an app as well as a desktop client/server application, which work in concert. It provides options trading as well as the usual trading of stocks; unlike RH, TIGR offers access to global markets, so from a single app you can trade the Nasdaq, NYSE, OTCs, LSE, Hang Seng, the ASX, etc. This is a powerful feature as I am sure WSB degens will appreciate: why lose money for 8 hours a day when you can lose it around the clock!

Tiger Trade provides full access to markets, eg pre and post. Execution is excellent, the interface is very good on the app (although not quite RH good, particularly when it comes to options), and the platform is comprehensive, offering up to the minute charting, news, analysis, all SEC filings, company profiles and analyst price targets, in a single place. You get NYSE Arcabook standard and can buy additional data packages. It is gamified, like RH, incentivising trades and encouraging community engagement by awarding ‘Tiger Tokens’ for various actions, including making trades, as well as ‘social’ actions such as commenting, sharing positions, producing DDs, and so on. These tokens can be used to purchase various items including ‘Commission-free trade cards’.

Which brings us to another matter – the cost of trading on Tiger. Signup is free (in my country, NZ, at least – I don’t know if this is the case elsewhere). Typically, a trade will cost you .99c US, no matter the value of the trade. You can’t trade fractional shares. Tiger Trade also supports short selling for the brave or really foolish (like me).

**3.** **The bad: It’s an ADR. And some other stuff.**

Probably the biggest risk I see with TIGR is its status as an ADR. While TIGR hasn’t ‘enjoyed’ the scrutiny of the CCCP which has befallen BABA, BIDU, VIPS and especially the edus like GOTU and TAL, it is nevertheless joined at the hip with other Chinese ADRs. This means whether or not the CCCP has a blowtorch on TIGR specifically, it is subject to the same vagaries of a dictatorial party, ie there is political risk either directly or by association. This has, I think, underpinned recent volatility in the stock, which tends to move in lockstep with the other ADRs…China stocks up, TIGR stock up, and vice versa. It’s a China stock, what can I say.

There was also the issue, so to speak, of a share issue in June, where a further 6.5 million ADRs were issued. In a statement, the company said the proceeds are to go towards (i) expanding its customer base and driving customer engagement with its services, (ii) investing in expanding its products, services and technologies to enhance its user experience and operating efficiency, and (iii) expanding its international presence. Issues are never good for existing holders, but at least TIGR didn’t include the ‘general corporate purposes’ which invariably means ‘We need the money for rent and salaries’. The other thing is that the offering is complete, so there shouldn’t hopefully be any further dilution on the cards for now.

**4.** **The pretty: A growth story**

Let’s take a look at some numbers. The company is currently valued at around 2.4 billion and has around 800 employees (compare with RH with a valuation north of 16b, and around 1300 employees).

At the last quarter, TIGR published the following results:

· Total revenues increased 255.5% year-over-year to US$81.3 million.

· Total net revenues increased 245.7% year-over-year to US$75.7 million.

· Net income increased to US$21.1 million from net loss of US$0.5 million in the same quarter of last year.

· Net income attributable to UP Fintech increased to US$21.1 million from net loss of US$0.2 million in the same quarter of last year.

· Non-GAAP net income attributable to UP Fintech increased to US$23.5 million, compared to US$1.1 million in the same quarter of last year. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to the most comparable GAAP metrics is set forth below.

· Operating Highlights for First Quarter 2021

· Total account balance increased 289.8% year-over-year to US$21.4 billion.

· Total margin financing and securities lending balance increased 177.3% year-over-year to US$2.3 billion.

· Total number of customers **with deposits** increased 180.4% year-over-year to 376.0K.

Right now, TIGR is trading at a PE of about 52. There’s plenty of volume, with around 10 mil per day, so liquidity isn’t an issue.

After the publication of these results in May, the share price shot through the roof, going from around 17 to around 28 in a little over two weeks.

**5.** **Upcoming earnings**

TIGR reports on 10 September (pre). Given the rapid expansion of its customer numbers in the preceding quarter, and given the growing interest in easy-to-use, affordable trading platforms not only in the USA but everywhere (and the Chinese are everywhere, along with compliant gweilos like myself), I fully expect the customer growth numbers to shoot out the lights. That share issue described above may even prove a major catalyst in driving customer growth, after all, they completed the offering fast and have the money, let’s see how well they have invested it.

My expectation for earnings is a big boost in the share price. Right now, with the Chinese ADRs experiencing something of a comeback, I have a price target of at least $24. That’s solid upside from the current SP of around 13.70.

**Position:**

6982 shares at 14.56. Looking for any dips below 13 to add more.

tldr; DRS ends fuckery by PERMANENTLY removing shares from the DTCC. Evidence with darkpool activity declining over last few days and continuing.

By the way, not financial advice. So don't listen to me, do your own research.

# THE NEW WAY: ""BUY, HODL, &amp; DRS""

I have proof that the mass exodus to Computershare DRS is the way. By removing shares from the DTCC it effectively stops synthetic/phantom/fake shares from being made. Have a look at the dark pool trading activity to see for yourself.

Also, I included popcorn because they have no catalyst and continue to buy &amp; hodl vs. the new *superior way* ""BUY, HODL, DRS""

Don't let the fudsters and shilling sway your opinion, you are the catalyst. RC &amp; DFV have been waiting.

For anyone doubting the way, have a look at this SEC report with someone you may be familiar with: [https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-dtc-2006-16/dtc200616-32.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-dtc-2006-16/dtc200616-32.pdf)

My favorite part from page 19/27:

&gt;Before I \[Dr. Susanne Trimbath\] left DTC in 1993, *I proposed and enhanced a service for the direct mailing of certificates by* ***agents to shareholders*** at the request of financial intermediaries through DTC. I also proposed, developed and tested automated direct withdrawals and deposits at custodians. Both programs are complementary services to DRS-TA, in that these were the refinements necessary to make DRS-TA compatible with DTC services. After I left DTC, I was told by TAs and former co-workers who remained at DTC that the relationship between DTC and the TAs \[Transfer Agents, e.g Computershare\] **deteriorated almost immediately upon my departure**, despite the fact that the department that I headed and developed, Transfer Agent Services, was expanded significantly in the number of staff assigned to the function. I mention this because I believe it places in context the events that follow.

As you can see, the Queen Kong Dr. Susanne Trimbath has been fighting this fight longer than anyone has for **shareholder rights**, since the 80s. Are you going to tell me DRS or Dr. T is a shillster or FUD now? GTFO.

Facts: DTCC has been screwing everyone over after Dr. T left DTCC in 1993. They are the FIRST BOSS in this saga, after they get squashed it will open the flood gates to Tendieland.

# THE FIRST BOSS: DTCC

Remember Cellar Boxing DD? Written by u/thabat. His discovery revealed who created the ladder attacks and even PATENTED IT! So who is this guy responsible for ladder attacks and daily red candlesticks?

**David S. Goone** is Chief Strategy Officer of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE). He is responsible for all aspects of ICE's product line, including futures products and capabilities for ICE's electronic platform.

The balls of this fucking asshole with crime under US patent ([link to Google patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7904377B2/en)).

Straight to the point, we're talking about $DOMA.

$DOMA went public in July this year via a SPAC. It was a shitty merger (*according to the market*) because the redemption rate was 85.5% which is super high (*as shown* [*here*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1C65RwHVSLOUKkuJaf3RgkeDiuMmhrMMKYncfM7YrF0U/htmlview#gid=0)).

This left them with a tiny float of just \~5 Million for a company with a market cap of $2.5 Billion! On top of that, they have options which shouldn't even exist for a company that has such a low float (*this is literally a loophole which SEC will probably fix eventually*).

Now what makes $DOMA interesting is the fact that it's overly shorted. The short interest ratio is **6.6 days**. What that means is that it will take 6.6 days worth of volume for SHORT-ers to cover their position. If they try to do it within a single day, I can totally see the price hitting $25 because of the lack of liquidity in this stock and the amount of Open Interest in option markets. Either way, there's a good chance it can unfold into a gamma squeeze potentially.

With all that being said, the IV on the options is going to be crazy but it can only get crazier from here.

Also remember they mainly cover the position towards the last 5 minutes of market close. Reason being that there are no margin calls issued before that. If anything, that's when you should expect to see major buying volumes.

Yesterday it closed at a low price of $7 and it hit $9 during after hours trading with respectable volume of 20,000 shares (*in 1 minute time period*).

Now here's the icing. DOMA has  managed to get a price target of $14.00 from analysts and a price target of $11.00 from Citi Group as well just this morning, Friday Sep 17, from Oppenheimer as well! These analysts know the company more than any of us apes in here. This is another instance of GME like stock being pushed down by the hedgies.

With some buy volume, the price action would be crazy for all of us to witness.

I've been playing with GME and the other charts recently, and it all accumulated into a massive piece of delicious TA,  which I didn't really plan to post to WSB originally - because I felt like some of the honorable WSB residents might be a little tired from that particular stonk. However, after seening [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pppfro/tmc_spotted_the_cock_and_balls_upside_down_head/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pph9f0/as_you_can_see_tmc_is_forming_a_classic_nut_sack/) beautiful examples of intellectual superiority, I just couldn't resist sharing my hard work with you, dear WSB!(If you, dear reader, are the one who is fed up with GME, then I would recommend you stop reading now and follow the two links above to appreciate HQ TA on other stonks).

For those, who stayed - enjoy the read!

It all started from my “L'Oreal shampoo commercial”-like hair bet post, where, in its third chapter, I was theorizing about GME's negative beta (particularly in light of the late January events, when the buy button was disabled) and the current general market setup - how it might influence subsequent GME moves. So, I decided to dive deeper into those correlations and deviations between the price movements of GME and other major assets, using January sneeze as the starting point. This led me to a fascinating, tits-jacking discovery that points at the upcoming inevitable volatile price action!

Buckle up for the TA journey of your life, let’s ~~dive~~ fly in!

Oh, almost forgot to quote Jack Black:

&gt;“This is not the financial advice, no.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is just a tribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;Couldn't remember becoming a financial advisor, no.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is a tribute, oh, to the greatest stonk in the world, alright!”

&amp;#x200B;

First things first, it’s a good idea therefore to revisit **late Jan events**, which in my opinion was the moment of revelation and a preview of inevitable storm, when:

* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,
* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a single day,
* and injuring SP badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, the thesis should sound something like GME🆙VIX🆙=SP🆘, and vice versa. It will be developed further in the next chapters.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, quoting my bet post here:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Pepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Categorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, I should recommend  you reading u/peruvian_bull Endgame series, and/or u/Criand the Bigger Short in order to develop the understanding of the fundamental processes taking place under the hood of the financial markets. To sum up the core idea: the financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standards, it is heading to the next, coming soon, financial crisis. And, in my opinion, what you can see on the charts above, was a sneak peak of the house of cards collapsing. Disabling the buy button was the only option for the big moni guys to stop (or rather to postpone) the system failing miserably. By bringing this dirty trick into play they were able to ~~buy~~ steal some time, which was necessary for deploying emergency measures and urgent market mechanisms (such as new DTCC/NSCC rules) - which, in turn, are aimed at mitigating the inevitable financial hail**shit**storm, ready to hit the fans.

There is a plenty of outstanding fundamentals DD on that topic (start from clicking profiles in the paragraph above). As for me, I am the TA type of a wrincle-brained ape, so...

Let me speak from my ~~heart~~ charts.

&amp;#x200B;

# II. Negative beta more beautiful than Catherine Zeta

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start from something that you must have heard about many times, but did you really dive into GME exceptional beta? So, what's that thing and why is it so negative? For the sake of saving my and your time, let me quote the almighty Inve**stop**edia:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In investing, beta does not refer to fraternities, product testing, or old videocassettes. Beta is a measurement of market risk or volatility. That is, it indicates how much the price of a stock tends to fluctuate up and down compared to other stocks.  
&gt;  
&gt;The value of any stock index, such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index, moves up and down constantly. At the end of the trading day, we conclude that ""the markets"" were up or down. An investor considering buying a particular stock may want to know whether that stock moves up and down just as sharply as stocks in general. It may be inclined to hold its value on a bad day or get stuck in a rut when most stocks are rising; whereas the beta is the number that measures a stock's volatility, the degree to which its price fluctuates in relation to the overall stock market. In other words, it gives a sense of the stock's risk compared to that of the greater market's.  
&gt;  
&gt;Beta is used also to compare a stock's market risk to that of other stocks. Analysts use the Greek letter 'ß' to represent beta.Beta is calculated using regression analysis. A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price tends to move with the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security's price tends to be more volatile than the market. A beta of less than 1 means it tends to be less volatile than the market.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Negative beta**: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely.

Essentially, negative beta asset is an asset that tends to move in the opposite direction from the general market. Famous precious metal is one of the good examples: gold and gold stocks have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines. That is exactly the reason why investors cherish this asset in the turbulent time of recessions, market crashes and corrections, or general uncertainty and volatility - historically gold tends to perform well during such periods, providing the 'safe heaven' to market participants and acting as a hedge. Noice, but this turbulent time we have something special on the horizon.

\*\*Le wild negative beta unicorn appears\*\*

Many of you must have seen -ß posts, but math and numbers are for geniuses, retards only understand crayons and visuals, so...

Ladies and gentleapes, with the great pleasure I present you the new negative beta king:

[GME v SP, daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/iwtaoohhc2o71.jpg?width=2039&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67b2824b31bf155c6f7d5f992c5141f67a82cdfb)

What you see on the chart above is a vivid illustration of GME's negative beta behavior, which commenced during/after the January sneeze. As for SP, the stable uptrend with the minor corrections is evident, while the asset is achieving ATHs on a regular basis. Looking at the GME now and connecting its highs with the median line, we may observe the opposite trend, as the line is descending. All in all, there is a big-ass convergence manifesting between the two assets, which most probably will result in the increased volatility and the explosive GME breakout / trend reversal for SP. Who will blink first?

&amp;#x200B;

[GME v SP daily chart + Tower of Pisa](https://preview.redd.it/3fiwmwwqc2o71.jpg?width=2033&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63ecddcaa4651b946a4df8541409c8d8e547d435)

Next, take a look at this chart. Don't worry about GME's Pisa offset here, as it is insignificant for the point I'm making (and I had some struggles overlaying the charts in this case). If the previous chart indicates a longer term negative correlation, the one above is like a zoom in: there is an obvious series of divergences and convergences highlighted yellow and blue respectively, which illustrate negative beta again, but on a smaller scale and with local trends. As you can see, as soon a GME bullrun commences and accelerates, SP dips, and vice versa. I hope, that the examples provided are persuasive, and that they helped you to reach the same conclusion as I did, namely: sstonk goes up when stonks go down, while when stonks go up, GME is suppressed = GME🆙SP🆘. Should that correlation continue manifesting itself (which I'm pretty damn confident it will), the exciting times are on the way.

Ok, so 🆙🆘 is a simple concept, but why is it important, you may ask.

Well, that's why:

[SP, daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/6b41eaewc2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9ae4bdc7758ecdbc84425e6ea567e1d4243f9e1)

SP has been forming a powerful bearish technical formation called the rising wedge, through the past year and a half. Currently it is narrowing down, and the point of breakout is not far away - typically it is to the downside for such a technical setup. Add GME with its negative beta to this equation - if you know, you know.

In one of my TA longwrites, the Big Short 2.0, I identified a beautiful, long term, juicy Elliott 1-2-3-4-5 impulse wave structure on SP, take a look! The investors are currently riding the top of the fifth wave, which is usually the most fun, euphoric and crazily risky. Everything in the nature works in cycles, and all the things that go up, must go down eventually! Considering the current bullrun being one of the (if not THE) most powerful and longest bullruns in history, you can imagine how nasty the retrace may look this time. Especially, when you take into account the fact that current financial markets are filled with shitty synthetic derivatives, excessive leverage of a bad quality, unthinkable level of risk, and... plain fucking crime. The financial world is craving for the correction (like Sahara for rainfall) and a proper bear market, as the deleveraging will make it healthier, and maybe, just maybe, it will bring price discovery back to life from the grave where it has been rolling for I don’t know how long.

Man, I wish there was a safe heaven asset that would protect me from the upcoming financial typhoon, the price of which would move the opposite way from the overdue nasty correction on all financial markets, which have been enjoying the most powerful bullrun in history for more than ten fucking years... Oh, wait!

&amp;#x200B;

# III. Chew it Over with VIX

&amp;#x200B;

Next, let’s talk about Volatility Index - what I noticed recently, is that VIX is often being neglected in the TA discussions, and in general also, so it’s a good idea to show it some love. Especially since GME and VIX correlate to a considerable fucking extent, but later on that.

To begin with,

[VIX, monthly chart ](https://preview.redd.it/1fcd3vlge2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78c23f899b3d623552b4b402c0abe74266108223)

The chart above is provided for the visual explanation of how this instrument behaves. In short, markeds kaboom TWIX wroom wroom. In essence, the Cboe Volatility Index is a market sentiment tracking index that represents the market participants expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. Volatility, or the severity of price fluctuations, is usually helpful to gauge market sentiment, particularly the degree of fear and uncertainty spreading on the financial markets. Investors use VIX to measure the level of risk, fear, or stress in the market when making investment decisions. It is an important index in the world of finance because it provides a quantifiable measure of market risk and investors' sentiments.

And who would have guessed, throughout the year VIX spikes have been accompanying almost every single GME major run, but for one:

[GME v VIX, daily log chart](https://preview.redd.it/ksd03p5pe2o71.jpg?width=1969&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=835dee5dd6c8b5367088857995e01a720f41f13a)

Just one major outlier to that tandem is late November 2020 run. Speaking of outliers, also VIX middle of June 2021 spike seems to stand out from the crowd, as there is no relevant proportionate positive price action on the GME side. Outside of those two occasions, the correlational behaviour of these two instruments is evident. Moreover, VIX and GME runs correlate to the extent that their peaks match time-wise in several run ups. Furthermore, take a look at how starting 2021 four out of five major VIX spikes correspond with the occasions when GME’s price action was trialling $230-ish level (margin call level, it seems) - the price territory, around which my concept of the ‘Purple Haze’ resistance (“break to initiate the squeeze”) is established, refer to the short squeezes comparisons post to explore the concept. The correlational behaviour described above, to my understanding, points at two big conclusions: the first and the most obvious one, is GME🆙VIX🆙; secondly, it seems that GME is currently the biggest risk for the market! - too much synchronicity is present between the two, for this to be a mere coincidence. Remember, VIX represents volatility, fear and stress - wut feelin Kenny?

Oh, and did I mention?

During the year and a half, the instrument’s price action has been consolidating into a beautiful bullish formation, called the descending wedge - which is exactly the opposite of what SP is consolidating into. VIX descending wedge + SP rising wedge + GME🆙VIX🆙SP🆘, quick math, and

Alright, that was quiet a TA journey. I hope that the discussion above helped you to build the solid understanding of what's happening on broader financial markets and how those correlations and tendencies are affecting GME price action, and will probably add the fuel to the rocket in the upcoming major GME moves. Now, the focus of the discussion is back on the GME current TA status quo! (yeah, finally!) And, what can I say, it is so fucking juicy!

Firstly, let me remind you about this TA of mine, which aged like a fine wine:

[GME, daily log chart ](https://preview.redd.it/ibiauo96f2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4645e967977f6c91ad71f07546993dc6140fda1)

The log chart support above proved itself to be an ape's ultimate best friend! As you can see, during the year, each time the price action approached the lower support, a sharp re-bounce followed - August and September confirmed the price line as THE most important support, manifesting the steadfast buying pressure. That pressure is currently confronting the most important resistance for GME in 2021 (magenta line). The battle will be legendary! (Hint: remember the current market setups discussed in II, and III, and the correlations? Based solely on that, what do you think the GME breakout will look like?)

But wait, there's more! Let's change the viewing ~~tri~~angle:

[GME, daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/nii0wtvhf2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29dc68d5034aa1a8258a22dae522f241ab3b196)

Hm, looks familiar. I swear, I must have seen this TA setup before! Oh...

[AMC, daily chart - 4 months old analysis ](https://preview.redd.it/aahe793pf2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce50af7363612d218d3f98ba410416dbc1e3cbdd)

Take a look at beautiful triangular wedge formations at the core of each chart. Retardos love triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarnate the flattening of the price accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is theatre stonk’s price action after the breakout. \*\* GME: ""Hold my beer"" \*\* I'm pretty much convinced, that the triangle on GME chart above is how the Mother Of All Triangles must look like.

Butth waaitt, therrz moooore! How about a monthly log chart bullish pennant?

Well, such a good note to end this massive piece of delicious TA on! What do you think, fellow professional investors?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: there is a strong correlational behaviour which goes like GME🆙VIX🆙SP500🆘, and which is evident when you overlay and compare the charts. According to the current ‘the everything GME’ market setup, GME is ready to moon fuelled by the upcoming massive VIX spike and the sharp SP 500 !negative beta rulez! correction (which is way overdue already, as the rally is longer than 10 years and SP is craving the proper bear market). Based on the TA outlook, the moment of revelation is just around the corner... There is only one safe heaven to protect investors from the upcoming financial typhoon, which goes by the name GME, so buckle the fuck up, shrinky brain astronauts primates!

Straight to the point, we're talking about $DOMA.

$DOMA went public in July this year via a SPAC. It was a shitty merger (*according to the market*) because the redemption rate was 85.5% which is super high (*as shown* [*here*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1C65RwHVSLOUKkuJaf3RgkeDiuMmhrMMKYncfM7YrF0U/htmlview#gid=0)). 

This left them with a tiny float of just \~5 Million for a company with a market cap of $2.5 Billion! On top of that, they have options which shouldn't even exist for a company that has such a low float (*this is literally a loophole which SEC will probably fix eventually*). 

Now what makes $DOMA interesting is the fact that it's overly shorted. The short interest ratio is **6.6 days**. What that means is that it will take 6.6 days worth of volume for SHORT-ers to cover their position. If they try to do it within a single day, I can totally see the price hitting $25 because of the lack of liquidity in this stock and the amount of Open Interest in option markets. Either way, there's a good chance it can unfold into a gamma squeeze potentially. 

With all that being said, the IV on the options is going to be crazy but it can only get crazier from here.

Also remember they mainly cover the position towards the last 5 minutes of market close. Reason being that there are no margin calls issued before that. If anything, that's when you should expect to see major buying volumes. 

Yesterday it closed at a low price of $7 and it hit $9 during after hours trading with respectable volume of 20,000 shares (*in 1 minute time period*).

Now here's the icing. DOMA has somehow managed to get a price target of $14.00 from JMP Securities and a price target of $11.00 from Citi Group! These analysts know the company more than any of us apes in here. This is another instance of GME like stock being pushed down by the hedgies. 

With some buy volume, the price action would be crazy for all of us to witness.

MM’s will throw EVERYTHING they got at us today, we must stay strong and fight back! I need every single retard, no matter how rich, to buy and hold. Today is the day where we decide the future of IRNT; if it will go down in history next to GME, or go down in rubble

If the stock closes above $45, MM’s will be forced to buy 5 MILLION additional shares. They will fight us and spread FUD because they know that they are fucked

The open interest on 9/17 is 320,000 meaning up to 32 MILLION shares could be purchased! That is literally 10X the ENTIRE tradable float

There is NO WAY they can obtain that many shares in 2 days

How play goes FULLY depends on what price we close at tomorrow. If we succumb to FUD and sell our shares, they win

But they won’t win! They are pinned against a corner. All we need to do is launch the finishing  blow and send this to the FUCKING MOON

tldr; DRS ends fuckery by PERMANENTLY removing shares from the DTCC. Evidence with darkpool activity declining over last few days and continuing.

By the way, not financial advice. So don't listen to me, do your own research.

# THE NEW WAY: ""BUY, HODL, &amp; DRS""

I have proof that the mass exodus to Computershare DRS is the way. By removing shares from the DTCC it effectively stops synthetic/phantom/fake shares from being made. Have a look at the dark pool trading activity to see for yourself.

Also, I included popcorn because they have no catalyst and continue to buy &amp; hodl vs. the new *superior way* ""BUY, HODL, DRS""

# LOUDER FOR THOSE IN THE BACK

For anyone doubting the way, have a look at this SEC report with someone you may be familiar with: [https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-dtc-2006-16/dtc200616-32.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-dtc-2006-16/dtc200616-32.pdf)

My favorite part from page 19/27:

&gt;Before I \[Dr. Susanne Trimbath\] left DTC in 1993, *I proposed and enhanced a service for the direct mailing of certificates by* ***agents to shareholders*** at the request of financial intermediaries through DTC. I also proposed, developed and tested automated direct withdrawals and deposits at custodians. Both programs are complementary services to DRS-TA, in that these were the refinements necessary to make DRS-TA compatible with DTC services. After I left DTC, I was told by TAs and former co-workers who remained at DTC that the relationship between DTC and the TAs \[Transfer Agents, e.g Computershare\] **deteriorated almost immediately upon my departure**, despite the fact that the department that I headed and developed, Transfer Agent Services, was expanded significantly in the number of staff assigned to the function. I mention this because I believe it places in context the events that follow.

As you can see, the Queen Kong Dr. Susanne Trimbath has been fighting this fight longer than anyone has for **shareholder rights**, since the 80s. Are you going to tell me DRS or Dr. T is a shillster or FUD now? GTFO.

Facts: DTCC has been screwing everyone over after Dr. T left DTCC in 1993. They are the FIRST BOSS in this saga, after they get squashed it will open the flood gates to Tendieland.

# THE FIRST BOSS: DTCC

Remember Cellar Boxing DD? Written by u/thabat. His discovery revealed who created the ladder attacks and even PATENTED IT! So who is this guy responsible for ladder attacks and daily red candlesticks?

**David S. Goone** is Chief Strategy Officer of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE). He is responsible for all aspects of ICE's product line, including futures products and capabilities for ICE's electronic platform.

So fucking sick of being poor, I stupidly signed up for STASH, and have experienced only headaches and cuckoldry since. 

They stole access from my account, first of all. Stopped me from buying GME when it was ripe to blow up, and more so when it was blowing up. Then, when changing bank accounts for transfer purposes, they wouldn't reply to contacts, refused to find my account despite thousands of dollars just sitting there and saying my email wasn't registered, when every fucking email I get from them goes to that same address. 

Took 3 weeks to finally get back into my account.

I was livid. I had to threaten legal action to get a live person on the phone who would finally fucking help me get back into my account. 

I told them I was going to liquidate my portfolio (on MY fucking timeline), and tell all my friends to liquidate theirs and never use them again, and to suck on deez nutz.

I start selling off my underperforming assets, and my portfolio diversity goes down but percent returns keep climbing, cause I averaged 140% \*like a bamf, thank you Daddy Musk for Tesla gains\* overall (it was 200% but I is dum),and I liked looking at my portfolio.

Then. Without warning, out of the blue a month or two after getting access to my own portfolio again, I get an email from STASH

""We are closing your account,it will take 7-10 business days""

And they just fucking LIQUIDATED my assets without permission, without review, without warning, and again are not replying to requests for contact or halting. 

So, true to my word, I'm shitting on their company in public, telling everyone I know what fucking bullshit conartist dick bag holding corporate chuckle fucks they are. 

I'd like to sue them for pain and damages, as they have blocked my ability to control my finances or access my portfolio, DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC, and the actual physical and emotional pain this caused my smooth brain has made me vewy angy. 

Then I though, ""Well, if they've done this bullshit to me, they've done it to others"".

So, if you've got a story about how STASH as a trading platform, of which you are or were a paying custy, FUCKED YOU OVER, please post it here. These stories will be collated, and I will be working to establish a pattern of bad behavior and bad faith dealings of STASH as a trading platform. If we hit critical mass, I'll run it over to a lawyer and check for the chances of tendies or tears.

There are still lots of obligations to purchase shares out in the market. Let’s run through the numbers. 

# The Story

Right now, there is a ton of calls loaded up for IRNT. A call is a contract saying you will buy 100 shares at a certain price (strike price), the person who sold you the call, must sell you 100 shares at the strike price of the contract. There are approximately 90,000 call options that expire this friday. If every one of them is exercised, market makers will need to buy roughly 9 million shares to fulfil their obligations. Now of course not every call is going to be exercised. [According to the CBOE about 10% of all options are exercised](https://www.moneyshow.com/articles/optionsidea-43293/). Historically 60%-65% of options expire ITM. This results in about 15% of In The Money options getting exercised. If IRNT expires at 45$ on Friday then that’ll be 8,427,600 shares that could be exercised. Since historically only 15% of calls are actually exercised, we take 15% of 8,427,600 and we get a dumbfounding 1,264,140 shares market makers will need to purchase to cover their calls! Currently there’s 1,226,524 shares in the market (The available number of shares is known as the float). Market makers will have to procure more shares than what’s available causing an Infinite Squeeze. Ideally, the more call options that are exercised and the more shares that are bought the more market makers will have to scramble to find shares. (So if you got options expiring this Friday, if you exercise them market makers will be forced to buy more shares). Today IRNT  blew past 45$ and peaked at 47$, if we buy and hold shares to go above 45$ by Friday, we can trigger an **infinite squeeze**. 

# The Short Interest

Yeah, I know. I know you are all sick and tired of hearing about sHoRtSqUeEzEs and all that garbage. I know everyone has seen way too fucking many of these posts, but hang on, because this is worth looking at. Right now, IRNT has a float of around 1.2 million shares. According to Ortex, the float was well over 5 million on the 13th. To get the % of the stocks shorted we get 5mil/1.2m for a casual 416% short interest. That’s like what, triple the size of GameStop? when GME was being shorted to all hell before poppin 400$/share... Not to mention this short interest was reported on the 13th... before IRNT doubled in price... breaking 40$... Not to mention borrowing IRNT shares requires a 544% annual fee. Yeah… 

https://preview.redd.it/o96i50cezxn71.png?width=1030&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f243e675a59c33f6b2a3a1e6c10b1d8d5ac2b809

It appears that market makers, like Citadel, are borrowing shares to cover their calls in order to buy some time. Market makers can’t buy off the open market since there’s not enough shares to go around. Since they gave their borrowed shares to the people that exercised their calls, they are now hoping that IRNT will become cheaper. Unfortunately for them, every month they wait, they get charged 45.33%  (544% annual borrow fee / 12). If we can get IRNT above 45$ for tomorrow and then people hold up shares then this shit is going nuclear. There are just too many obligations to purchase shares out in the open market. This bomb is triple the size of GME and is primed to blow. Buy up shares, exercise options, i’m loaded to the tits and ready to lactate and fully ejaculate. 

# Reversal

Honestly the only way this can go tits up is if nobody gave a damn and everyone sold... which i guess very much could happen. I don't know why you would sell or stop caring for something this big. It's literally free money. Buy the stock, price goes up, hold it a bit, and then boom the stock will blow up and it'll blow you.

If the share price being elevated is already bound by warrant exercise/redemption timing, it'll be extremely sensitive to any capital raise efforts by the company. That means the companies won't be able to raise much capital to benefit permanently from the squeeze. So the price will probably go all the way back down to pre-squeeze levels.

Moreover, most of these companies were overvalued to begin with. That's why they were trading under NAV. They have smaller floats than expected but that doesn't mean they're undervalued like the original squeeze plays were last year. Don't diamond hand thinking you'll be able to sell at a higher floor months later like GME, AMC, etc.

Another problem is that if squeeze buyers keep pursuing new plays in a zero sum set of plays, their capital will spread thin and become less powerful. The upside illiquidity pressure needed to spark a squeeze requires focused conviction buying. Therefore, future squeezes will be less dramatic or not happen at all.

For example; If you made 20k in your wendys job in 2021 and you made 80k from your GME options and you sold them - your Total income for the year will be 100k. This means you will owe roughly $22k in federal (not including state taxes) 

Ok how to harvest the losses.

For some of you with diamond hands and holding unrealized losses , i.e. you bought AMC at $70 and its at $46.85 ; for you to realize the loss you need to sell the stock and NOT trigger the wash sale.

The wash sale rule - you will defer realized losses if you sell and reenter the same stock or option 30 days before or after the date of closing the position.

Now for those that made it this far:

How to avoid the wash sale rule but not miss out on gains:

1. you SELL call options that expire 30 + days from now = you're going to sell your stock at that strike price - meaning you will realize the loss.

2. At the same time - you BUY call options 60 + days from now = securing a reentry price incase your position goes to the moon in the next 60 days.

3. At day 60, 2 things will either happen; 1. The stock price will either be the same or lower and you will get to reenter your position and lower your capital gains tax or 2. The stock price jump and the options you purchased 60 days ago will offset the reentry price.

Since you are purchasing the options 30 days prior the sale, the wash sale will not triggered when you sell the stock. Thus you've secured a nice reentry position and most important of all you saved yourself from owing more taxes

Before doing any of this i recommend the following:
1. Estimate how much you will owe in federal income tax with your job income + short term realized capital gains (take into account if you have state income taxes)
2. how much the realize loss you can harvet and is it worth all this trouble
3. Do you anticipate any movement in the next 70 days (give or take)

No one wearing a Patagonia vest was safe from this man’s conquest of sending a couch to the moon. 

In what made the Hunt Brothers look like little stains on a toddler’s underwear, this man’s stock corner ranks as among the most epic of all time. 

He bought 50% of the float of a stock almost overnight in plain sight of hedge funds who refused to see his vision, forcing them into stock loan recalls and unimaginable pain. And while most would brag about not resting, this man rested….in Mykonos taking bikini pictures with his wife just to taunt hedge funds. 

After his squeeze, what did he do? Did the stock plummet? No. He rested some more, bought a $40MM house…and then made his stock go up another 600%. And the man is not done.

The man known as “G-Fried” is Gary Friedman, and one day you’ll buy a couch from him. He would have been friends with Vanilla Ice but does not like the flavor vanilla. This man likes it spicy, or at least flavored and this is his story…

&amp;#x200B;

 **TRIPLE TAP – YOLO’ing HIS ENTIRE COMPANY:** Before we think about $RH stock, let’s analyze analysis how this man put $BOFA $DEEZ $NUTZ on the line with a dramatic recapitalization that resulted in one of the world’s greatest stock corners, aka the “Triple Tap.”  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8mw86g0ygsn71.png?width=568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95f0519f9f5dcaea9e276dbf5511fdf101a98ebd

  

Rewind the clock to before Gen Z existed: the year was 2017 and an Orange Man ruled the world. $RH stock was in the dumpster and its bonds traded below 40c on the dollar. It is only logical that a CEO would take out a ton of bank debt and then announce, one after another, stock repurchases.  When announced, $RH had a market cap of just $1BN with $500MM of net debt 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6jnxsgm1hsn71.png?width=582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61609fe2a3492764e0e543387b3ba91f23715ddc

  

After buying $1.7BN of his stock back, when most of Wall Street thought he was bankrupt, Wall Street analysts asked a simple question: “WHAT IS THIS GUY DOING?” This was G-Fried’s answer: 

&amp;#x200B;

This is what happened to $RH’s balance sheet:

A lot less shares…but a lot more debt. What did this man see? Usually, you only bet $ONE of $DEEZ $NUTZ, not $BOFA $DEEZ $NUTZ when you feel good about the future. This CEO YOLO’d his company

Gary saw a disruptive business model, with a near monopoly on luxury furnishings, in a market that was ridding itself of real estate that enabled him to build shrines of greatness. Below is what happened to sales. At first, they went up. After COVID, they mooned.

**$RH POST YOLO, A COUCH COMPANY THAT THINKS IT’S A TECH STONK:** Today, $RH has continued to crush. What does $RH look like today? At face value, it looks like a hedge fund short come true: A company investing massively in super duper large furniture sales rooms and a company that sends out “brochures.” 

But what is actually happening? $RH is thinking big and going big. The Company’s Design Galleries double retail revenue and profitability in each market they enter, providing huge synergies between the physical stores and the direct online business. This creates massive synergies with customer acquisition and brand building. Competitors, meanwhile, are stuck in a downward spiral of closing or downsizing their stores while $RH builds the largest specialty stores in the history of the industry.  

&amp;#x200B;

$RH continues to elevate its brand by expanding its brand portfolio. There is now RH Interiors, RH Contemporary, RH Modern, RH $AMCStonk, RH Beach House, etc, etc. The Company is going to include Plane and Yacht design to further elevate and inspire customer. $RH is and is cementing its position as one of the world’s great luxury brands. 

$RH believes that it could reach $25BN in sales in its current form. As it elevates itself in line with Hermes, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Cartier, etc, the Company will not trade at 4x sales, but instead move upward to the valuation range enjoyed by European luxury houses. Hermes, for instance, trades at 15x sales. At 10x sales, RH could reach a $250bn valuation, which would equate to a $12,500 share price (up from today’s $700 share price)

Why have the big moves for the most recent squeeze targets been happening after hours? $SPR (forbidden ticker) and now $IRNT moves seem to be happening almost completely after hours. Maybe 1 mid day halt for each and they never come out of their respective halts and pop like $GME and $AMC did. 

Have hedgies and those responsible for the huge short positions learned how to react to these squeezes? Is it a lack of a United front from retail buyers? Is it some discord investment group manipulating these plays? (See CLOV idiocy of the last week/few days.)

Something in the air is bringing you nostalgia from January 2021. The sentiments and emotions are bringing back memories. A feeling you thought would never happen again is returning.

A bunch of apes on WSB spot an unusual co-existance and series of events underlying a very rare opportunity to occur. Gathering option chain information and spotting OI% reaching absurd levels in comparison to the very small float of the stock. Looking further into the stock they uncover that it's heavily shorted. Actually more than heavily shorted because the typical online market reporting systems are including locked shares into their calculations. Ape then sees that the float is actually so small that even the slightest price action creates a reverberating effect to its volatility and price movement. Each share bought and owned, is literally increasing the price. 

A lasting effect could potentially not be disturbed. These degenerates as they call us have understood one key modo. When MM's and SHF start targeting small companies to leverage their loses in the market, they have to deal with the very same reality as retail investors, and that my friends is risk.

When we're caught, we need to pony up. There's no form of exoneration for any class. That is what's important. If you're prepared to take the risk and lose, you better pay the toll like we all have.

MM's and SHF took a very risky and bold move once again and I fucking hope the SEC is watching because if this shit hits ATH like we all know it can and anyone of them brokers start restricting purchases. Well boys the great GME and AMC MOASS may even grow bigger.

$GME $AMC $IRNT $OPAD $TMC 

Hedge funds and financial institution over leveraging in an already insanely over-leveraged economy and market. Literally playing with peoples hard earned money. Working for every dollar owned and only for it to be taken because of a broken system that failed you. Yet the ones in control of that market get to walk away Scott free and even return.

The citizens of the world are in an incredible time in history where their growing to realize that they have a very powerful influence and impact on the economy and society of the world; more so than ever before.

It's not what it is that has value, but what it is to you that has value.

What a story that would be.

Disclaimer:  this is not meant to be political or anything of that nature in anyway etc. This is just a shit post.

Also, fuck Evergrande, those cucks literally stole from all of their clients and investors.

Last post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pobzn6/update_irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_273_of_float/hczwo2g/?context=3)

I wanted to give an update on the gamma squeeze I've been following on $IRNT.

*Quick comment on the 13D filing. This was expected (for a change, lol) and the shares are subject to lockup.*

Since my last post, the percentage of float claimed by institutional obligations has risen from 273% to **479%** of float.

Today we saw movement confirming an active gamma squeeze. Tomorrow, after a gap up, should be the first day of ***full squeeze*** movement to be compared with AMC on 06/02 and GME on 01/26 with a peak occurring on Friday. My PTs stay the same, the ones we haven't hit are now just more likely.

~~Most Likely:~~ **~~$29~~** **Broken in intraday today 09/15**  
~~Likely:~~ **~~$40~~** **Broken in post market 09/15**  
If everything goes right: **$135**  
If it matches other squeezes: **$210**  
If it goes to the moon: **$530**

As I said in the other posts, this situation is highly unusual and the low float on this stock enables it to run really fast and really hard when buy volume comes in. This also makes this play very risky so only partake with money that you can afford to lose.

**Good luck and godspeed gentlemen.**

$URA (uranium ETF) and others (which I cannot mention) have broken out to 7 year highs. The spot price of uranium mimics both of these charts. They have a symbiotic relationship, like a shark protecting the little fish which eats stuff off of its back. A week ago the spot price of U was less than $28/lb. Today, as of right now, the price shot up to $45/lb. This is a huge factor for the bull case. *In 2007 the spot price of uranium peaked at $135/lb*. 

That was 10 years ago, and with a quickly increasing spot price, markets were flooded with sells/asks shortly thereafter. The sells were from the heap of new mines which popped up, due to increased demand. When demand tapered off, so did miners. 

Now that there are less miners and a huge potential for even more demand soon, I believe uranium is ripe for parabolic movement. This is not financial advice, I could be wrong.

Hello everyone, yesterday I made a post about why I think IRNT is one of the best opportunities retail has ever seen. Generally, this post got very good reactions but there were definitely some people who said I was retarded and that the play was dead. Though I definitely am retarded, the play is clearly not dead. Now that I have your attention about the potential of IRNT and you've seen SOME of it's potential, I'd like to discuss the stock more.  

First, I wanted to link the recent DDs of IRNT that have been on this sub: 

[My recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/poe2gb/irnt_is_the_one_of_the_greatest_opportunities/)

[An update to the above post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pobzn6/update_irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_273_of_float/)

There are probably others as well but these are the ones that I based my DD off of

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary of the IRNT play**

IRNT recently started trading. Websites are reporting a short interests of 56% 233% and all the way up to 550%. Websites like iBorrowdesk and Fintel are consistently reporting less than 1000 borrowable shares. Because of redemptions and lockups, the float is extremely limited to about 1.3m shares. Unlike most stocks in this position, the stock has options that would only be available to a stock with 10x larger float. Additionally, the amount of options that are ITM and are expiring ITM on Friday outnumbers the total float. In most stocks on this sub that have squeezed, short interest has been the only factor. This stock, however, is similar to AMC and GME in that it has a disgustingly high short interest AND the ITM options expiring on Friday out number the float. That is why this stock has the highest squeeze potential since GME and AMC. Additionally, the stock is on NYSE threshold list, which indicates that it has too many FTDs, which is further evidence for this play. Very few stocks make it on this list and it is a sign of over-shorting. The stock has been on that list since 9/2 and, per regulationSHO, forced deliveries of FTDs will begin next week. The aligning of forced delivery of FTDs, option delivery, and an insanely low float presents a unique opportunity. There has been some confusion as to whether this play ends on Friday or if it goes into next week. The answer is unequivocally that the play goes into next week - that will be explained below. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Next week is the real play**

There has been great confusion about this play regarding the lockup period. I have had several people message me and comment saying that the lockup period ends on Friday, which would allow more shares to come into the market and would end the play. This confusion comes from how people have interpreted point 1. of u/stonkgodcapital first post:

https://preview.redd.it/6v7id3mcrpn71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=278bdafec942c361184281add312aa739542f170

I have talked to the user to clarify this and have done my own research to ensure this is accurate. When I talked to him, he confirmed that he was saying the redemptions and lockups will keep the float at 1.3 million AFTER options expire Friday. He was not saying the lockup ends on Sept 17. He was saying that the float will remain small WELL AFTER options expire this week, so when options must be delivered next week and the float is still small, a squeeze could happen because the shares that must be delivered outnumber the float. I also did further digging. I could not find a single source that said ANYTHING about more shares being added to the float anytime soon, lockups ending soon, etc. I looked at [IRNT's form 8-k](https://docoh.com/filing/1777946/0001193125-21-263381/IRNT-8K) and found that the lockup ends 180 days after August 26, 2021. This makes sense because that is a typical length for SPAC lockup periods. So, in case you did not understand: THE LOCKUP DOES NOT END FRIDAY AND THE FLOAT WILL REMAIN MINISCULE NEXT WEEK WHICH WILL ALLOW A SQUEEZE TO HAPPEN.

Therefore, the real play here is next week because: the float will still be small, shares will have to be delivered next week and the amount will outnumber the float because of the current OI on options expiring Friday, and forced delivery of FTDs will also occur next week due to the stock being on the threshold list since 9/2. HOWEVER, because of the low float and high Reddit interest, I do expect this stock to continue trending up for the rest of the week - so we very well could see extremely high prices come friday but I still believe that next week is when we see the peak.

What happened last week was after IRNT initially popped, then people lost interest, so it fell back down. Today, the stock got more interest and absolutely took off - that's the power of a low float stock. However, this stock presents a special opportunity because it has a low float AND the number of ITM options that could be exercised next week outnumbers the current float of the stock - that's why this is one of the best opportunities WSB has ever seen. If this stock continues to gain traction, there is nothing that can stop it because of its low float. 

**Earnings**

IRNT also reported earnings yesterday (it's called a surprise earnings and is because it's newly trading). The earnings report showed a wider than expected loss. An earnings report of that kind should make the stock go down or, at the very least, be flat for the day. Being up 20%+ makes no sense, so the only explanation is that the squeeze theory for this stock is correct. Please note that this is a side bar and has basically no bearing on the play - I just included it because earnings happened yesterday. 

**Conclusion**

IRNT is the first play since GME and AMC to have a disturbingly high short interest, extremely low float, and ITM options expiring in the near term that outnumber the float. This stock has both short squeeze and gamma squeeze potential. It is important to note that the lockup DOES NOT end on Friday, it ends 180 days from August 26. Because the lockup does not end soon (keeping the float small), ITM options will have to be delivered next week, and regulationSHO will require delivery next week, this play GETS BIG next week - we will probably see more gains this week, but next week is when it gets real. 

I am still in on the play and have no touched my position since yesterday. See my previous post for a screenshot of my position. I plan to hold all of my shares until well into next week.

The whole GME thing is what brought me to Reddit/WSB months ago. I followed the saga as just an onlooker. It was one of the craziest fun things I've ever seen.

Over the last few months I started buying into the MOASS hype, and started with just a few shards of GME and eventually AMC. 

&amp;#x200B;

After getting sucked in on some of the other subreddits dedicated to these two stonks, I decided to go full degenerate and bet my entire investing portfolio on the MOASS.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reaching out about withdrawing your shares to DRS - apologies for the delay, though we're happy to provide you with some more details.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of the special nature of a share withdrawal, there are fees involved in processing your request:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Our agent charges a fee of $232 + HST per withdrawal of a US security, which is a requirement for the shares to be re-registered in your name directly with the transfer agent. Please note that we do not reimburse or cover this fee. 

&amp;#x200B;

2.There is a special handling fee of $37.50 + HST to facilitate this manual transfer.

&amp;#x200B;

These fees total $304.54. If you decide to proceed, we will arrange to have these fees charged to your account. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please note that the process to change the registration with the transfer agent will take some time. We estimate the overall processing time for this type of withdrawal to be 3-4 weeks, however, it may take longer. We will process it as quickly as we can. Once the withdrawal and re-registration is complete, further transactions will be done directly with the transfer agent. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you would like to proceed, please reply to this thread to let us know, and make sure you have an available to trade balance of $304.54 CAD within your Personal account to cover the fees outlined above. We’d then be happy to process the request! 

&amp;#x200B;

If you do not have $304.54 CAD within the account to cover the fee, the withdrawal cannot be processed. In order to create the required cash balance, please either liquidate a sufficient number of shares within your account, or set up a deposit by following these steps. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please let us know if you have any questions— we’re here to help.",True,False,False,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,10835851,public,confidence,self,Wealth Simple now allows GME transfers to DRS,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/povfc3/wealth_simple_now_allows_gme_transfers_to_drs/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At every turn over the last year the fed has shown they will back the banks and the hedge funds, and that things like the SEC exist more for them than they do us. Example: Gary Genslers assault on cryptocurrency.

He's coming after all of it, in the name of ""consumer protection"". Look at the Ripple case. These asshats are trying to cover up the fact EMPLOYEES OF THE SEC WERE SHORTING XRP WHILE OPENING LITIGATION ON THE COMPANY.

As a result it was delisted from exchanges and the holders trapped. However you can still buy XRP, just go to Coingecko, search XRP, click on exchanges or markets, and it will tell you where to buy. This will open the flood gates, forcing exchanges to relist before the case resolves, put Gary in his place, and send the fed a message. You could also probably make a boat load of cash as the relisting is coming with or without us.

$GME/$AMC QUICK OVERVIEW:

It's no secret that Hedgies fuck3d up incredibly bad and I mean catastrophic bad. 

I know it doesn't seem like it now but once the Squeeze is done and over with expect the worst! (Kinda like 2008 but worse)

Kenny was/is POKING @ THE ENTIRE ECONOMIC BUBBLE as a whole with a giant ass needle! (Still Naked Shorting Stock)

If we did not catch on to them, that could’ve been the end of GameStop as we know it. 

So now they're stuck in their never-ending loop because Dumb Money straight made Smart Money look like B1tch Money! 

WE WON A LONG TIME AGO. (Friendly reminder) 


THE IMPORTANT PART

DO YOU KNOW WHY THE SEC HASN’T ACTUALLY DONE ANYTHING??!

1. A majority of us are pulling random shiet right out of our asses! (We’re Chickens running around with our head cut off) 

2. MOST OF US THINK THE SEC ISN'T DOING ANYTHING... 

3. !!!THE SEC IS BEING FORCED TO MANIPULATE THE MARKET ALONGSIDE THE HEDGIES!!!

Why?

BECAUSE IT'S IN THE MARKET'S BEST INTEREST AS A WHOLE SADLY. (LIKE I SAID EXPECT THE WORST AFTER THE SQUEEZE)

What/When/How?

UNTIL THEY FINALLY AND I MEAN FINALLY (WHENEVER THAT IS) CREATE/APPROVE ALL NEW REGULATIONS! WE ALL NEED TO HOUND THEM ON THIS RIGHT HERE SO THEY QUIT DICKING US AROUND! 



Something I just thought of now. I’m willing to bet Gary asked RC to hold off the NFT Dividend until said regulation is passed... (Maybe?)

I have been looking at large options trades that occurred between the 10th of January and the 10th of February as well as the net cumulative premiums and I thought I would share it for future reference.

 The thing that is the most striking, is that there were a lot of them. Even though the movement was driven by retail investors, some large investors were on board and helped create the squeeze. The 2 largest options trades over that period were for \~$50.5 and \~$33 million dollars. These are huge. Both executed above the ask. You can see here the top trades for the period. The vast majority of them being calls.

If we look at the net cumulative premiums (among large orders), we can see that, even though both calls and puts spiked, call premiums outweighed puts premiums (approximately $250 million dollars extra on the call side).  Perhaps, with all these calls outstanding, it would have been a great opportunity to keep squeezing the stock... The net premiums were slightly positive in March on the second run-up and only slightly positive today.

Even though the recent large options trades have been mostly on the bullish side. The number and size don't match the level of January. 

[Large trades for the last 20 days](https://preview.redd.it/zxflc0ufeon71.jpg?width=1619&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=894d011fdc0d03c1091a19dd1ada9f1391379ade)

The distribution of call premiums remained however quite large, with several bets being made with strikes as high as $950.

Even though the WSB community is now larger than ever before, its ability to create a squeeze has not necessarily increased. Sponsoring multiples stocks at the same time certainly reduces the amount of capital available for any given target. Focusing on a specific stock and creating that feedback effect that attracts more and more money is crucial. The community needs a process for optimizing its capital allocation. The easiest way to do so is to follow the path of least resistance and pile in where the money is already flowing...",True,False,False,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,10835235,public,confidence,self,Large

In one day the share price peaked from $4.73 to $9.79. Buyers refused to listen bears explaining that the 5.6 billion share count was too high to move $NOK. Instead they kept buying hitting 1.2 billion volume in a day before trading was halted.

&amp;#x200B;

**Global leader in 5G networks**

To keep it short Nokia is currently a network company. Main competitors being Huawei, Ericsson and Samsung. You can still buy Nokia branded mobile phones and other products under their licensing agreements, but the core is in the networks (fixed and wireless). Heart of the R&amp;D is an iconic Bell Labs. Key words to current Nokia are 5G, edge cloud, AI, IoT etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Share count vs Market cap**

Nokia share count is 5.6 billion and market cap $31 billion (9/17/2021). During the meme action people figured out that the market cap 26.4 billion in January is what really counts, and this proofed to be right. It really doesn't matter if there are 5.6 billion shares at the price of $4.73 or 1.12 B shares with the price of $23.65 - exactly the same market cap.

As a comparison this year $GME and $AMC market caps peaked $37.3 B and $36.9 B respectively. However, $NOK didn't have a huge short position for leverage but instead it was and still is a value play with EUR 3.7 billion net cash and solid profitable cashflow. It is an undervalued quality stock in the blink of a turnaround. To give some perspective Nokia market cap was in January 2021 one tenth of Cisco's.

&amp;#x200B;

**Renewed product portfolio is second to none in the industry**

Let's face it, Nokia had problems with 5G product portfolio development after it acquired Alcatel Lucent in 2016. Company simply didn't have enough resources to focus on 5G product line while they were busy to merge ALU and Nokia 4G product portfolios. So, they ended up taking a shortcut by using programmable FPGA chips in their products instead of more efficient and cost friendly SoC chips.

Eventually Nokia focused to SoCs in 2019 and it took two years to catch the competition with new Reefshark based products using SoCs. In July 2021 the huge workload was pretty much done and at the end of this year over 70% of shipped products will be based on SoC's and the new deals will be more or less all part of the renewed product portfolio.

Now that Nokia has catched up the gap to the competitors in product competitiveness it is adding even more firepower to the R&amp;D efforts which can be seen as a good sign. Main target is to be the best network company in the industry and according to the management we will see some new exciting product launches still in this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Main competitor still banned by US government**

US has been accusing Huawei about close connections to Chinese communist party and sees it as a possible security threat. Therefore, it has been warning other countries to avoid using its products and about a year ago even banned Huawei to buy much needed 5G chips. Naturally the company bought as many chips to stock as it could but it’s now running out of parts (much worse situation compared to January 2021).

Their mobile handset business is currently sinking (no new 5G phones at all), and it seems that for base stations it must start using less sophisticated and more energy consuming components manufactured by Chinese suppliers. So, they will be able to deliver products but at what cost?

There have been articles stating that Chinese government should compensate energy costs to operators in order to make the new products more appealing. Pretty much the same strategical approach which Huawei has been successfully using in the past decade stealing market share from Nokia and Ericsson by selling products even under the price of components. All this has been possible because Chinese government has been subsidizing the company generously. Sad side effect has been that even there are a handful network providers left in the industry it has been hard to make any profit. Now it seems that US ban is changing the game and market share is flooding to western rivals which can start raising their prices and margins to reasonable levels.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall the global situation is much different than it was a couple of years ago. It’s too risky for operators to focus purely on buying less secure underpriced Chinese products as their own government or consumers might turn against them. For operators it’s more important to do business with reliable and ethical partners. Nokia is a good choice as it has been named by Ethisphere as one of the 2021 world's most ethical companies.

&amp;#x200B;

**Competent management with can do attitude**

Pekka Lundmark is the current CEO following Stephen Elop and Rajeev Suri. He did a much-needed strategy review in the company about a year ago and since then the progress has been convincing. Nokia buried its end to end strategy, business unit heads are now fully responsible of profit &amp; loss and the decision making is not anymore scattered around the organization. All businesses are seeing growth and the change is already visible in the financial numbers even the three-year strategy execution is only in its first phase.

Pekka has also totally changed the company's comms policy. Nowadays Nokia is very transparent with its comms. It prefer to set lower targets and give surprise profit raises instead of promising the moon from the sky in the first place. The new policy might seem pessimistic to some but to be honest the overpromising strategy didn’t work well either and shareholders along with analysts lost the faith to the company. We might argue that the current undervaluation is indirect consequence of bad comms and it simply takes a few solid quarters to convince otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

**COVID and future technologies supporting 5G ímplementation**

COVID boosted the network usage globally and we are seeing growing demand for better networks with higher capacity and lower latencies. However, behind the scenes there is much more happening. Companies and research labs are inventing killer apps and products to best use 5G networks. For example, VR and AR could potentially be something to wait for.

Big problems with VR/AR have been the storage, power consumption, and processing power. 5G will solve the problems by pushing these  away from the PC and into the edge cloud. Imagine the next Facebook where people will get a totally new sense of immersion with VR/AR. When this happen the consumers and companies will be begging for growing 5G availability with more bandwidth and lower latency capabilities.

Private wireless use cases and smart city solutions are key parts to lead the next technological revolution with significant productivity gains and will grow the demand for high quality networks. Lufthansa, many ports and mining companies are already taking advantage of early wins to beat the competition.

Oh boy, oh boy when the first significant use cases for masses pop up. The demand for high speed networks will skyrocket and I bet that the few relevant network companies will not sell their products and services cheap now that Chinese are not anymore disrupting the markets.

&amp;#x200B;

**What analysts are saying?**

Analysts focusing on the company are much more optimistic than the market currently. Last week Goldman Sachs raised their target to 6.10 EUR.

&amp;#x200B;

Closing price (September 17): **$5.50** (4.70 EUR)

Target price: High $8.27, Median **$7.12**, Low $5.75

Buy: **17**, Overweight: **3**, Hold: **9**, Sell: **0**

&amp;#x200B;

**Peculiar trading activity this week**

Nokia stock has been arrogantly used to rinse option players every now and then by market players. It seems that max pain levels for option players have been reached time and again. Actually, this happened past weeks as well when the share price was pushed from $6.29 (peak after Nokia raised their guidance for 2021) to $5.50 without any negative news. Someone adjusted the robots well as the closing price on Friday was precisely $5.50 (maximum gains for bankers). Only medicine to stop this kind of activity would be to grow the faithful owner base so it would be more difficult for market player to move the share price. Eventhough in the longrun these kind of short-term movements are meaningless.

With these levels, next week will be a great buying opportunity for long-term investors who see the underlying potential in this hidden gem. Not even meme phenomenon is needed to reach the double digits in $NOK share price in the coming years.

Before I discuss what we as investors should be focusing on as we hold our shares for eternity, we need to discuss some ethical concerns that have been popping up and have some merit. We know that everyone and their mother is saying that the stock is going to {Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. I appreciate the recognition of $SDC from everyone across the internet and comparing it to the likes of $GME, $AMC, and a company that recently merged with $GREE. I can't mention the company directly because the visual mod marks the post as spam. However, there are issues that should be recognized that hurt attempts for a short squeeze. I would rather us as investors and degenerates focus on what really drives share price appreciation. I look forward to your criticism.

**""{Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. ""**

By making this statement, it actually hurts any attempt to grow confidence in a shareholder base to buy and hold. Please do not be the person that does this and if you see it happening, then kindly correct the individual. If the share price reaches the claimed price within the timeframe, then great! No harm done, but the opposite is what is causing the below two scenarios and is happening 90% of the time causing fizzle and not sizzle.

a.) Investors that see these price targets within the specified time frames being tossed up willy nilly will see it as a pump and dump and disregard any information regarding short interest, free float, Cost to borrow, and Failure to deliver. At this point, an investor decides to not join in a legitimate attempt to squeeze shorts. At the current moment, there are plenty of these investors not joining. Most importantly, the whales. Whales want verifiable information and are the reason why I'm making this post. Although your 400 shares are valuable, we need whales to take interest.

b.) ""Please fly again."" Do I need to say more? Investors/degenerates that expect a price to come and it never does. If the share price does return from a $HD sponsored short ladder attack it creates selling pressure from those that are scared that this is their chance to get out breaking even.

c.) ""It only will go to x."" This again causes selling pressure and may cause opportunity cost and chasing for FOMO and being in the same position as shown in point A or B.

With this being stated, let us get to the meat and potatoes.

**""Putting two and two together""**

As we have seen from our friend on WSB that discussed de-hedging the tiny float as shown here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc\_dehedging\_the\_tiny\_float/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc_dehedging_the_tiny_float/)

The user alluded that, ""*CTB spike predicts FTD regulation*\*\*"".\*\*

I shared a post on [r/stocksdc](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocksdc/) discussing that share prices going up significantly lagged FTD when there was a bullish sentiment with a stock. Of course, the share price does not always go up immediately when it's being shorted into oblivion, but when there is sustained buying pressure and lack of turnover from the new buyers, then price changes get interesting. Especially when the cost to borrow goes from 1% to 40% and investors are diamond handing them shares. I remember a similar post on WSB months ago showing the lag, but I sadly can't remember the user to credit them. If you have the link, then message me and I will edit it.

**""The Recipe""**

1. High short interest.
2. The Catalyst that the shorts are not expecting.  

   1. Buying pressure will need to be more than, ""It has high short interest bro. Trust me.""
   2. Catalyst needs to be present to encourage other investors that it is truly a long-term hold if it is the worst-case scenario and the squeeze never happens.
3. Increase in Cost To Borrow (CTB)
4. Increase in Failure To Deliver (FTD) due to naked shorts with continual buying pressure
5. Increase Share Price

I know not all FTD are naked shorts, but these circumstances are different considering $SDC has \~50% SI of free float per Ortex.

This is how you decipher if this is a pump and dump for you whales out there or concerned investors.

1. Is there high short interest? If not, then P&amp;D.
2. Is there a catalyst?  

   1. Is the company expected to go bankrupt and it actually becomes profitable? Is there a major change to regulations or the way they operate that allows the company to make more profits? If yes, move to the next. If no, then P&amp;D.
3. Is the cost to borrow increasing? No? P&amp;D.
4. Is there bullish sentiment? It doesn't matter as to why or what type of catalyst it is. Is the buying pressure large and consistent? If not, then P&amp;D and probably doesn't have a true catalyst.
5. Is FTD increasing from the most recent SEC report that lags behind semi-monthly? If no, P&amp;D.

Now to some graphs! For those that are bullish regarding another potential short squeeze, then take a look below. Please know that $SDC could become profitable tomorrow if they didn't spend half of their revenue on marketing. They are a growing company that is creating almost $800 million in revenue with the only competitor being $ALGN and the monopoly that is ortho. Why do you think there is so much short interest.

Below are some nice pictures with arrows and circles to make it easier for some of those reading.

Graphs being provided are from the i-borrow desk with the help of the Wayback machine to access some older Cost to Borrow data and the Securities Exchange Commission FTD page.

**""Changing Attitudes with Retail and Whales""**

What I mean by the title of this chapter is that by referencing $GME and $AMC they are completely out of the normal. It seems that there were huge amounts of FTD and ridiculous CTB % for both stocks right around April and May after covid-19. Right around September and October, some buying started taking place as a recovery play, and the DD on the consoles being delivered allowing GameStop to not go bankrupt started a lot of consistent buying pressure that no one expected(Catalyst). Everyone expected the earnings to be spectacular and they were! So, shorts did not consider this unexpected catalyst and the above formula took place. It did not happen in one day. It took multiple consistent weeks of buying pressure until the shorts were ~~bailed out by corrupt Wallstreet and $Hood~~ covered. But those investing in this were doing something no one has ever done. There was no confidence behind this play except for those that had high conviction. As you will see with the $GREE acquisition, the ape mentality is growing but should grow based on data as shown here and not baseless hype.

$AMC is a bit different because after it spiked to $20+ lot of people jumped out due to FUD, Potential dilution, Chinese convertible shares, but when you take a look at Iborrowdesk now, CTB spiked again causing the shorts to ""cover"" sending it to $69+

Also the ~~larger than normal~~ bo·da·cious [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious\_(bull)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious_(bull)) volume we saw over the past week was held down. Yes, we know there were penny flippers, but you are telling me that was normal? I've seen $GME and $AMC when it was taking off. What I watched was anything, but ""normal"".

**$SDC Catalysts**

So hopefully I have brought some general light on what to look for in regards to approaching a short squeeze and determining if it is a P&amp;D.

Now for $SDC. Does it have a catalyst? I'm thinking yes on three parts. I'm leaning on number 2 heavily because that is the only thing it needs.

1. The recent medicare news including dental is something that no investor could have foreseen and more buying pressure ensued because of it on August 30th. At this point, I'm not sure when this will pass, but the Whitehouse is quoted from the Washington Post, ""Democrats intend to provide a benefit that offers seniors financial assistance next year for dental, vision and hearing care while the formal benefits are set up.""
2. Every short is expecting $SDC to go bankrupt. Once $SDC tapers its marketing in the slightest they become profitable. Look at its peer in the industry $ALGN. Look at the P/S ratio. When $SDC becomes profitable I'd only expect a fair price compared to its peer in the industry.
3. NBC Settling out of court for $2.85 billion.

First of all i wanted to say that i have exited most of my shares and only have about 10% of my original amount of shares left in $IRNT.

Now, i see alot of people talking about the people still holding $IRNT are bagholders.

I would like to argue that its not the case. 

$IRNT had a whole 5 green days. Almost no real dips. 

The dips we have seen so far have all been real minor. From 45 to 36 and the right back up to +40. 

This dip that we are in right now is not at all a huge dip if you look at the bigger picture. 

For the people that bought $IRNT last monday, this dip is nothing, we're all still in the green.

Now looking at the charts, every run we've had has come with a dip after it. Now the difference is this run we've had has been huge there fore a bigger dip then usual.

&amp;#x200B;

And now you cant forget that there is a really important thing in stake here.

**MONEY**

We all love money, we are addicted  to money, we will go to any extent to get our money.

And we cannot forget that we are batteling against huge Hedge Funds with alot more capital then the average Joe has.

They are risking their jobs, for this. 

They are not going to let us just predict a squeeze like that, they knew people were ready, they knew that people thought Friday was the **BIG DAY**.

What other way to make people sell than to disapoint their huge expectations.

We've already seen this before with **GME**, the extent to which the Hedge Funds went were extreme.

The tactics they used were under the belt, all for a bit of money.

They arent going to let us apes become rich and thats a fact, the system is rigged, and theres not much we can do about it.

So back to $IRNT

We saw a dip which was not according to **OUR** plan.

But probably according to **THEIR** plan.

And many bought in to it, calling eachother bagholders, when a stock that has had a massive bullrun just had a correction with about -30%.

And listen im not an expert, and im not here to say that theres more to come from $IRNT.

But instead try to calm people down, cause people make this situation seem a lot worse than it is.

  
This could be an case of a large P&amp;D and has left people bagholding.

But this could also just be a dip which is going to lead to much greater things with a little bit of patience.

But remember this was only one market day, and i've been in on **GME** through many storms and disasters.   


And this is really nothing compared to that.

Im still in on $IRNT with a small portion of shares cause i dont want to miss out on a great play.

But take everything with a grain of salt and dont invest more than what you're willing to lose. 

Which is going to prevent these kind of situations.

A [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pq0aiy/gme_is_about_to_fuk_u_with_its_negative_beta/) on the front page has claimed that GME has a negative beta, which it quite skillfully proves by rotating a screenshot of GME relative to SPY (does this guy work for Goldman?) after seeing different sources show GME with a negative beta post squeeze. He then takes this full proof metric and uses it alongside an equally undeniable technical based bearish SPY prediction to suggest you should buy GME. This man somehow knows for certain that SPY will go down, and instead of leveraging to the tits on puts like a true degen, betting against the livelihood of millions of working class people, he peddles you his hefty bags.


**But what if GME’s beta wasn’t actually negative 😲:**

Beta is a metric, which aims to correlate the price action of a stock relative to the overall market through comparing returns with SPY. Beta can be calculated in a variety of ways over a variety of different data sizes (var/covar, relative fitted slopes, etc. over 1-5Y at a daily, monthly, tri-monthly, or yearly rate).

Now, beta for GME since the squeeze has been negative for a variety of sources. One example is [Zacks](https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/GME/fundamental/beta), which has it dropping to -2.21 post squeeze. The thing is, that number is based on a very specific distribution of data points and weightings (most probs equal) that change from one calculation and broker/site to another. What if I told you we could calculate beta ourselves?


**Please be careful ⚠️Retard At Work⚠️:**

I have chosen the most commonly used and relevant method to calculate beta, which takes into consideration both relative volatility and direction of movement since others may only take into consideration one:

The standard deviation of the asset’s (GME) returns (daily and monthly percentage change) over the designated period (multiple periods to show how they differ) divided by the same thing for the benchmark asset (SPY) multiplied by the correlation (R, pearson’s) between the returns.

The idea is that the standard deviation division represents the relative volatility and correlation shows direction. I have also done the analysis over different periods and bin frequencies to show how beta changes. Now, you can get historical data from any site (marketwatch, yahoo, zacks, etc.) and you can run the analysis, which you can check [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fnR3ncF4ifq7vTE9KOvanPLf76UydxF7?usp=sharing) and (please feel free to look it over as I did this after 16 hours of work today (don’t get into consulting kids) and may have made some errors).

Results:


Daily:
5Y (starting from today): R= 0.09  ,  β= 1.18
3Y : R=0.09  ,  β= 1.21
1Y : R=0.03  ,  β= 1.02
During first squeeze : R= -0.3  ,  β= -38 (wew)

Post-squeeze : R= 0.68  ,  β= 17.8 (kek)

**Hmmmm but what does it all mean…🤔:**

As you can see from the data, monthly vs. daily does affect the data (which is part of the point, you can’t just pick a random number you saw on the internet and use it but claim every single other one is cooked by the illuminati) but the same general patterns appear. Note: There’s a possibility where the way you pick your bins completely hides both squeezes (taking returns before and after with the squeeze is in the middle), so there are issues with how time periods are set.

The 5Y and 3Y data shows that GME (LIKE ALL FUCKING STOCKS except like gold and stuff) are completely correlated with the market in the long-term. For the 1Y, the monthly data begins to show the early signs of reversal which would eventually lead to the squeeze and is still positive, since SPY always goes up since JPow, peace be upon him, says so. During the squeeze, all shit goes to hell and SPY tanks (we’ll go over why soon) and we get these monstrous KONG LEVEL negative betas. However, post squeeze for both data sets shows that we actually are insanely POSITIVE. THIS should be the apes’ thesis. That the stock is actually in an insane upwards trend and THAT’s why you should go long, but for some reason apes not only want themselves to be rich, but for everyone else to be poor.

**CommentaREE:**

Now, why is beta negative for other sources? Because each site calculates it in its own way. Their distribution of bins, their starting points, and potentially their weightings change everything. Some calculations may be weighted more around this year or by extent of price action. FFS the monthly beta for the squeeze is -138 (NEGATIVE ONE THIRTY EIGHT). You don’t think the effect of that will distort numbers for a while?


Why was beta negative during the squeeze (and similarly but to a much less extent on the other runs)? The first run scared the market because of the back ups in the clearing houses. The volatility caused by these stocks (highest retail volume of all time btw on Jan 26-27) caused issues with T+2 clearing, since brokers were clearing trades that the DTCC said they didn’t have the funds on hand to cover the risk for. Which shows why we need same-day clearing, but that’s a whole other thing. Since SPY had already hulk-dicked its way out of COVID and felt overextended at the time (lmao if only they knew how strong the printer brrrs), people started to pull their money out because the system was potentially going to be DYSFUNCTIONAL. No clearing = NO TRADING AT ALL. Other squeezes since (as evidenced by the post squeeze betas) have not shown the same dips since there was no systemic risk. 

On the other side, the idea that the market crashing will cause GME to moon is fundamentally utterly retarded (not in the good way). If the thesis is built around naked shorting (which isn’t on any books and requires no return/cover since there is no borrowee), why the FUCK would there be a buyback, if no one can see them on any balance sheets. Now, say you wanna flip flop again randomly and mix theses like you’re a bunch of bored thirteen year olds experimenting with bodily fluids. If the shorts are borrowed and hence on someone’s balance sheet and the market begins to crash, NO ONE WILL GIVE A SHIT ABOUT MEMES. There is potential that memes get piled into by funds that got out early or are liquid, as institutions know apes and tards alike would literally go balls deep long if they see their ticker moving up, even if SPY is on its way to the Earth’s core. However, there’s no way to know for sure that will happen, but I can assure you that maintaining their actual GIGANTIC giga-cap longs that they hold on insane margin/leverage and ensuring those stay afloat will definitely make them think twice about holding GME at $200 to sell IV off.

In sum, just because someone says something and uses memes to prove their point, although quite amusing, doesn’t mean they’re right or have actually looked at any data or EVEN UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN THESIS. Do your own DD, or just chase a de-space redemption gamma squeeze play you barely read in the daily, idk I’m not your dad (I hope).

TL;DR: Long term beta is 1 (cuz all stonks, including SPY go up). Squeeze beta is negative because of systemic risk caused by issues/rumors about back-house clearing and risk based collateral requirements increasing as well as an insane squeeze. Post-squeeze beta is actually POSITIVE AS FUCK, and could potentially be the real reason you would want to go long, but will surely fuck you if the printer runs out of ink (it wont, $SPY 690 coming to a theater near you soon).",True,False,False,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,10844917,public,confidence,self,Is $GME's beta really negative?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqbq28/is_gmes_beta_really_negative/,some_ads,7,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'rXWe1fahlvTGLTZ4W051gVoy14Fze-256cUC6xzbeQw', 'resolutions': [], 'source': {'height': 72, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QI5iGl-ZvtFDdwgem41jZqv-hdVKidnan3sLgmkVNE0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=c95cf917a5dab610f4b51ee4982f2c4235def321', 'width': 72}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No, of course not.

Didn't have time earlier, but wanted to explain how shorts are actively attacking your options positions and in doing so leave themselves open to future regulations. 

**Post summary (tldr)**

\- Shorts attempting to knock price below strikes are hurting themselves when the MM(s) hedge.

\- Short interest at 49mil should be understood next to the 97mil float of which 86mil shares are owned by institutions. This means that short interest in **500% larger** than daily trading float.

\- CTB is increasing significantly, by multiples now and the result of which is likely FTD regulation.

**Short strategies**

We're seeing the same pattern after hours currently that we saw the last couple days.

Short playbook

1. Destroy momentum by shorting any perceived breakout (there were net 1.2mil shares shorted today). 
2. Market sell huge orders to encourage strike breaking and selling to also achieve this.

But... Didn't work so well, because when price moves beyond the strike threshold, the MM(s) generally choose to hedge their risk. This is well known, but I took some crayons to draw the picture to make it easily understandable.

[Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/v2fao3x355o71.png?width=3219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98447970ab5457d1f0ede10d79d3e2433eaf40bf)

This is happening after hours right now. I'm curious what will end up happening here. Short's goals are to knock it down below $6.5 by market extended close at 8:00pm set to render calls useless. From the looks right now, seems like it's not working.

**Constrained float**

This is why I'm extremely bullish. Stupidly bullish.

Turns out institutions own so much of the float that the actual daily trading float is only 1/5th the size of the amounts of shorts. That's right. **There are 500% more shorts than typically available shares to trade**.

[Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/ck4kijx555o71.png?width=1509&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f40592f07ad91ef0d443411775a8ba135b09f33)

**Total float: 96,000,000** (Bloomberg)

**Institution shares: 86,000,000** (Bloomberg)

**Actively traded float: 10,000,000**

Read that again. There are 10,000,000 (10mil) shares generally traded unless an institutions offloads which happens rarely.

**Shorts: 49,000,000** (Ortex)

You read that right.

There are 49mil shares compared to an actively traded float of 10mil. Literally 5 to 1. 500%. This is insane. So what will happen to price? Nobody knows - but here are the price levels. Price moves quite quickly between stops since high frequency alto's run this all.

**Future FTDs?**

Almost assuredly. CTB is spiking - this means there is extreme demand for shorts and limited supply. FTDs are when shorts are lent to sell short but aren't actually available in the Dealer's inventory to deal out. When this happens enough, securities are placed on the [FTD regulation list](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=RegSHO) which means significantly more restrictions and forced closeouts - highly bullish to price.

Here's the chart of CTB. 

[CTB spike](https://preview.redd.it/mkxzrfq855o71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d71c3b9894accd2aa6819d4bfcabef1f286432c)

This is beginning to move from linear to exponential and implies severe pressure on dealers to keep up with demand. In my opinion, it's a short amount of time before this happens.

In tandem with the reg SHO list comes our favorite short squeezes (GME, AMC, IRNT, SPIR, etc etc etc). Except this company has 80% institutional holdings and no lockups expiring... Think you can see where I'm heading here.

***Floating Stock***

Floating stock is the most narrow number of a company's shares. This measure excludes closely-held shares that are held by company insiders or controlling investors. These stockholders typically include officers, directors, and company-sponsored foundations.

u/Investopedia listed this question and the answer as below:

***Can Float Be Higher Than Shares Outstanding?***

***No***, float—short for floating stock or floating shares—can't be higher than shares outstanding. It's always a smaller figure because it only counts the number of shares available for investment and trading on financial exchanges. In contrast, shares outstanding include both tradeable shares on the open market and any restricted or closely-held/insider stock—essentially, all shares that a company has issued, So, float is always a portion of shares outstanding.

It should be worth $100 today but is worth less than $10 because hedgies keep printing fake stonks. It's the same play every week for them. They pretend to let it go up early in the week and let retail traders buy options and then print a lot of fake stonks to sell and keep the price down at the end of the week and prevent any breakout upwards momentum and people making it to the money. But they don't unprint their fake printed stonks so there is probably a lot of fake ones all over the place which they will need to buy back eventually.

The hedge funks have been doing this to TEVA for a decade and think they can get away with it and never buy the fake stonks that they sold back. They are spreading a lot of fud about pharmaceutical companies like TEVA which is the biggest and best one saying that TEVA isn't making money. But their DD is missing a key ingredient that they are not accounting for that as more and more apes are joining the stonk market, they are becoming more dependent on their adhd medication. Apes can't afford the name brand adderol until gme and amc lose their shorts so for now there is all of a sudden millions of apes in need for generic adderol and TEVA sells the best ones. Trust me, I am on adderol right now. An ape can hardly pay attention to gme and amc price for longer than 5 minutes, but with TEVAroll ™ an ape can double or even triple their attention span and focus on buying more stonks even faster than hedgies can print them.

TEVA is going to make so much money from selling generic adderol that they will start buy backing their stonks even if they are fake ones from the hedgies. TEVA will probably bring back their money per share deal that they took away for some time to prevent the fake shares from getting extra money. In conclusion TEVA future is brighter than a freshly picked out banana rubbed in butter in a dimly lit amc theater.

Also, this is an opinion about TEVA stonk and not advice... 😉

The $DUDE here with my periodic ""Dude Diligence"" reports on $CLOV - Clover Health Investments Corp and thoughts on potential price action for the upcoming week.  Be prepared to read a little bit, but it will be worth your time if you're seriously considering trading CLOV

I want to start off with a quick intro- I'm a long-time lurker here on WSB but rarely post.  I joined a little over a year and a half ago right before COVID hit as the subreddit was on the verge of breaking 1M Degenerates.  I spend a bit more of my time on Twitter and am active there if you care to follow me aka, The $DUDE  ([https://twitter.com/nikiped1a](https://twitter.com/nikiped1a)).

Anyway, I don't want to make this too long but I've been trading for about 16 years which started with a single $2000 deposit as a college student in my early 20s which was a good chunk of my net worth at the time.  That $2K has grown significantly over the years through working, trading and has been diversified into real estate as well.  I work in tech for a publicly traded software company and now have few healthy trading accounts (primary trading, IRA and Roth IRAs) where I mainly swing/momentum trade some YOLOs and occasionally invest longer term if I feel there's a disruptive technology/company w/ high upside potential. 

Originally I came to WSB for the memes and then quickly realized it was a really helpful community w/ useful crowd-sourced info, strategies and data in addition to the solid meme game.  That was before it exploded 10X over about a 6 month period time leading up to the GME and AMC squeeze craziness earlier this year.

While I will say most of the info here is still good for the most part, you do have to dig a bit deeper now, verify a little more often and pushback on a lot more misinformation than in the ""early days"".  And that brings me to the point I'd like to speak about today.  Misinformation and how it has run rampant especially when it comes to Clover Health Investments Corp aka $CLOV.

I've been trading this stock since late Feb and seen the many ups, then downs, then big ups again and then downs.  But more than anything, I've seen and still see the disruptive potential of A.I. in a dinosaur of an industry that is Healthcare.  Here's my fresh take since I know there are a lot of new traders/investors in CLOV and a definite uptick of late in interest to potentially invest moving forward... (Disclaimer:  I am not a financial analyst, this is not financial advice, it is solely made up of my own personal opinions.  I do currently hold a position in CLOV for obvious reasons once you read through this)

&amp;#x200B;

**STORY TIME**

I'm going to start this all off with a little story...

Once upon a time, there was this new fangled company called Tesla and it was forward thinking and it was technology obsessed and was innovation first and they wanted to build cars.  

Well, the collective good ol boys (GoB) club that makes up the automotive industry saw this quirky autist lead company and laughed at them and pointed fingers at their silly electric motors with ""auto pilot"" and weird frunks and batteries- WTF??.  

The GoB don't like disruption.  Instead, the GoB loooove the status quo- because they're on top and in control, so why wouldn't they?

This TSLA company didn't care that they were getting the cold shoulder and started to build their cars that were never going to succeed and they were actually pretty f\*cking bad ass.  

""There's no way this TSLA is a viable long-term company- they don't have the recharging infrastructure, there will never be adoption by the masses and ultimately they'll run out of money, "" sneered all the GoB execs along with the know-it-all stock analysts, big banks, Jim Cramer and all his Wall St. buddies.  

And then something weird happened ...people started buying these electric cars and buying them and buying them even faster.   We all know how this story ends.  The GoB are now scrambling to catch up and acquire similar technologies to compete w/ the O.G. disruptor.

This is what happens with disrupting companies- they see problems and their leaders are visionary problem solvers and refuse to follow inefficiency and the status quo.  And it's weird because when these disruptive companies pop up, you'd think they would be praised and their industries would welcome their new ways of thinking.  But that's not real life- instead they're mocked and told they'll never make it and to give up because deep down the GoB know the legacy way of thinking is in danger of drastically changing and all of the sudden the go from leader to playing catch up.   So the collusion begins and they do all they can to ensure there's a failure to launch w/ negative publicity, or just ignored altogether or shorted or all of the above.  Whatever it takes to kill off the ""perceived threat"". 

Well, there's another company similar to TSLA that's looking to disrupt another Dinosaur industry- Healthcare and healthcare may be the oldest most dinosaur of the dinosaurs...  This company is $CLOV and before many of you in here sneer and mock- hear me out over the next few paragraphs.  I will support my DD w/ data, Press Releases, Quarterly Financials, etc, not opinions...

&amp;#x200B;

**CLOVER HEALTH IS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY FIRST**

First and foremost $CLOV needs to actually be seen and recognized for what it is at it's core- NOT a meme stock.  Clover Health, at its foundation is a Technology/ Artificial Intelligence company that just so happens to focus on the Healthcare/Insurance space.   It is a meme stock because it's heavily talked about here on WSB, but this is actually a long-term growth stock with rapidly improving fundamentals, massive growth... and down the list, the potential of a squeeze, but that is secondary in my mind.  I'l Long on CLOV

&amp;#x200B;

**CLOVER HEALTH's MISSION STATEMENT**

*Clover is a healthcare technology company helping members live their healthiest lives with its Medicare Advantage plans. On a mission to improve every life, Clover uses its proprietary technology platform to collect, structure, and analyze health and behavioral data to improve medical outcomes and lower costs for patients. As a company whose business goals fully align with its members' health needs, Clover works with members and their doctors to become a valued partner. Clover has offices in Nashville, San Francisco, Jersey City, and Hong Kong.*

It's a next-generation disruptor in that it has developed proprietary AI technology called the Clover Assistant (CA). 

**Clover Assistant Explanation Video:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4S8oDou4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4S8oDou4k)

What's great about this is that it integrates with all FHIR EHR's (Electronic Health Record systems) ...hospital systems, doctor's offices, pharmacies, etc. use to store and manage patient info can all integrate easily with CA.  This allows for real-time data visualization &amp; reporting at doctor's fingertips so they can not only make the best possible decisions for the health of their patients based on all available info across all EHR systems, but also concurrently make the most cost-effective decision from a business standpoint (improved margins compared to competitors w/o a similar type technology.)

**Aug 10, 2021 PR Link:**  Now integrates with all FHIR-enabled EHR's

**Sept 8, 2021 PR Link:**  Clover Health partners with largest EHR company AthenaHealth for seamless integration of Clover Assistant

[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-integrates-clover-assistant-athenahealths-market](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-integrates-clover-assistant-athenahealths-market)

You want to know what is also pretty f\*cking awesome?  They could also potentially license this software to other healthcare orgs at some point, i.e. Software-as-a-Service or SaaS.  I work in this space and have been selling SaaS contracts for the better part of 2 decades.  

My previous company had a stock price of $15 when they were selling ""perpetual licenses"" aka, dinosaur software sales model.  ...when they switched over to a SaaS their stock price climbed over $500 over the next 10 years.  Did I play my ESPP during time?  Uh, you know I did!  In short... just this software component alone could have a massive potential if played correctly.  Of note, I don't think that is currently in the works at the moment, so none of that potential is priced in.

&amp;#x200B;

**TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET**

CLOV plays heavily in the Medicare and Medicare Advantage space.  Currently citizens in the US are eligible for Medicare at 65 years old and about 60M people or 18% of the country are on it as of 2019: 

https://preview.redd.it/xkm6dlk8o5n71.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48ef0dd7523641c089b72e8da7d0f9f468cb889d

Look at the Baby-Boomer jump beginning around 2006 and that sharp increase.  It's expected to continue the rapid rise and if the eligible age is dropped from 65 to 60, that could add another 24+ Million (a potential 40% bump) to its total lives managed under the program.

A unique component that CLOV has when it comes to lives managed is that it has a direct contracting entity (DCE) program 

**Info on DCE Program:** [https://www.cloverhealthpartners.com/en/](https://www.cloverhealthpartners.com/en/)

**Quick Video on Program:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlTnq7cIoKM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlTnq7cIoKM)

(...and someone correct me if I state this inaccurately) but my understanding of DCE (and it's by far the most exciting growth component that I've seen so far related Clover's massive upward revenue trajectory from Q1 to Q1 ) ...under direct contracting entity, Doctors are able to sign patients up individually, outside of the normal Oct 15 - Dec 7th Medicare Open Enrollment period.

&amp;#x200B;

**EXPLOSION IN REVENUE GROWTH YEAR OVER YEAR**

Here are Data from CLOV's most recent Q2 10Q filing on Aug 11, 2021:  

**Total Q2 2021 Revenue was $412.5M, which was a 139.7 increase YoY** compared to $172.1M in Q2 of 2020.  $216.4M of that was just from Direct Contracting- are you seeing why I'm pretty stoked on this hyper-growth company?

Total **revenues for the full 2021 year are now expected to increase from $810-$130M which was reported following Q1 earnings to $1.4- $1.5B** following Q2 earnings.

Total Lives (customers) under Clover Health management at the end of Q2 was approx. 129,000, **an increase of 126.3% YoY GROWTH!!!**  This has mainly come from the DCE program since it has only been available to Clover since they were included in it along with 52 other companies earlier this year. 

**Lives under Clover Assistant management grew by 229% YoY.**

**Clover expects a significant increase in total aligned beneficiaries on Jan 1, 2022**, when claims aligned beneficiaries for 2022 become active - Uh, you probably want to jump onboard sooner than later given this projection.

 If this alone isn't enough to get you to jump on board blindly w/ no questions asked, I don't know what to tell you.  If you can tell, when Q3 earnings are announced on or around Nov 11, 2021, CLOV could rocket if Q3 report is anything like Q2, especially with a couple of weeks of Medicare Open Enrollment being included in this upcoming ER.  

**CLOVER HEALTH's EXEC TEAM:**

Take a look, you have a mix of former Google, Uber, (remember how I said it's a technology company)  United Health Group, McKesson

&amp;#x200B;

**CLOVER RAPID EXPANSION IN COUNTIES WHERE THEIR SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE**

CLOV just expanded its market from 108 counties in 8 states to 209 in 9 states (101 county increase) as of June 24, 2021, meaning essentially all of the earnings data I listed above were from the smaller market, so growth will continue to accelerate rapidly

If that wasn't exciting enough, shortly after announcing the new counties, they announced on Aug 3, 2021 they will be entering a new state, the 10th, with their new partnership w/ ValueH.  That state just happens to be Florida- the third most populous in the US and a huge Medicare state.

&amp;#x200B;

**HEADWINDS, MISCONCEPTIONS &amp; OUTRIGHT LIES**

Market manipulation w/ the price is probably the biggest headwind.  CLOV, along with GME and AMC have got to be the most manipulated shares in the history of the stock market.  Market makers and HF have an uncanny ability to nearly always pin the price on Fridays just below the options Max Pain price collecting premium for them and allowing them to do it cycle after cycle so they're making up the cost plus some of whatever the borrowing fee is.  The more of the free float investors buy up and hold, the less ability they have to manipulate.

I've heard people talk negatively about losses.  Well, when you're in healthcare, and we're in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, your Medical Cost Ratios will get out of wack temporarily and that is the case over the past couple of quarters.  MCR was at 111% during Q2, however, Q2 of 2020 (before much of the COVID expense hit) it was 70.1% according to their earnings report. 

[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/149b80af-b48f-419d-aa4b-ad5dca7801db](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/149b80af-b48f-419d-aa4b-ad5dca7801db) 

Free Cash Flow (FCF) has also been talked about and has been affected as this company is in growth mode, however, it has improved tremendously: +31% from Q1 to Q2.  It will be interesting to see where it goes for Q3.  Definitely moving in the right direction toward getting into the black.

Also much of the expense costs for Q2 were one-time line items related to stock compensation and the cost of warrants to the company (warrants along added -$134.5M in debt)

As of the end of Q2, CLOV had $630M cash and equivalents in the bank, so they can sustain losses for awhile without issue.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO TRADE CLOV**

OK, this is getting kind of long, so I may type up a more comprehensive list with more info, but I want to get into some of the anomalies if you choose to trade this stock.

Short Attacks:  Watch out for what looks like a mass selloff right at market open almost every day, shorts always short millions of shares each morning to kill off momentum and scare paper hands and inexperienced traders.  It generally comes back after about 10:30-11am ET when the shorts return their shares because they're just looking to scalp 10-40 cents or so each day and then return them for some profit.  If we're buying up all the float, and not allowing them be be shorted, HF and short's wont be able to do this and we start to gain ground.

Which brings me to this- IF there's anything I hope you learn from reading my DD today, it's this:  **DO NOT BUY CALL OPTIONS ON THIS STOCK.  If you do, they will most likely end worthless on Friday's and you will lose your money.**  

I know options are normally an attractive opportunity to get into a stock inexpensively because if it moon's at some point, you make a grip on a small investment, but I've been trading this for months, and seen it happen many times over- you will lose your money.  

Instead, BUY ACTUAL SHARES!   Help buy up the float and HODL!!  This is going to be a volatile potentially few months as we start making progress vs. the shorts to jack them with an impending squeeze, options have not been working, nor will they, it appears, in the short term.  There may be some opportunity to buy and profit from options once momentum is in bulls favor, but that time is not now.

I hope this was helpful, I know it's long, but if you made it to the end here, really consider getting into this stock, it has a lot of things going for it and it's only $8 right now.  Even without the squeeze potential that exists, this could easily be $20-30 with it's extremely rapid growth of their Direct Contracting.  If you're holding it long, then when the squeeze does happen, it's just gravy.  

I may have missed a few things, but if so, I'll just follow this up with another post here in the next day or two.  Would love to hear all of your feedback and/or differing opinions on this.

-----------

There are basically two parts of the cycle which seem to play out over a few months.  The pump phase is pretty clear.

#Pump Phase

Key features are momentum, hype, and ""new recruits / fresh money"" who keep buying at the relative top.  IV tends to be elevated.  


Apes and FOMOers are buying lots of calls.  IMO calls are quite risky unless you buy small amounts and feel very confident about timing a retracement dip.

CC's and short puts are fairly safe money.  I actually prefer CC's provided you have enough margin to keep naked calls open.  This allows you to dump the shares and flip sides quickly when the trend reverses very strongly.  With short puts you can do a sort of reverse CC, but you need to short shares to hedge if it reverses.  But IMO this is a bit more dangerous because when there is a reversal it is typically more rapid than a decline.

#Dump Phase

Characterized by slow bleed or sideways shuffle as IV gradually trends downward.  ""New money"" is not infinite, when there is a brief pause, people are hesitant to stay in or buy.  Writing options are way less lucrative and there's a lot less room to hedge and react appropriately.  In this phase there are two ways to effectively play this IMO.

Try to time the bottom with cheap calls.  Eg. GME at $150 showed very bullish indicators of a strong reversal.

I first posted this yesterday.  A LOT of angry people downvoted it to oblivion but I follow this famous quote:

-----------

There are basically two parts of the cycle which seem to play out over a few months.  The pump phase is pretty clear.

#Pump Phase

Key features are momentum, hype, and ""new recruits / fresh money"" who keep buying at the relative top.  IV tends to be elevated.  


Apes and FOMOers are buying lots of calls.  IMO calls are quite risky unless you buy small amounts and feel very confident about timing a retracement dip.

CC's and short puts are fairly safe money.  I actually prefer CC's provided you have enough margin to keep naked calls open.  This allows you to dump the shares and flip sides quickly when the trend reverses very strongly.  With short puts you can do a sort of reverse CC, but you need to short shares to hedge if it reverses.  But IMO this is a bit more dangerous because when there is a reversal it is typically more rapid than a decline.

#Dump Phase

Characterized by slow bleed or sideways shuffle as IV gradually trends downward.  ""New money"" is not infinite, when there is a brief pause, people are hesitant to stay in or buy.  Writing options are way less lucrative and there's a lot less room to hedge and react appropriately.  In this phase there are two ways to effectively play this IMO.

Try to time the bottom with cheap calls.  Eg. GME at $150 showed very bullish indicators of a strong reversal.  If a seemingly strong support is broken decisively you can hedge by shorting shares and create a synthetic put.  Alternatively if it's not seeming to approach a bottom any time soon, get cheap puts and convert to synthetic calls instead if there's a reversal.",True,False,False,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,10826326,public,confidence,self,How to properly swing trade meme tickers.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pn4h13/how_to_properly_swing_trade_meme_tickers/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Part 1. Technically Anal**

So this past week saw a considerable breakout of the $9 resistance wall and a concomitant FOMOing into the ticker with FD's destined to Lambo or Burn. Well those FDs are either now ash or in a giant gasoline-soaked pyre, but let's have a look at the charts to see if any of the poor bastards holding 9/17 $17 calls can be saved.

First, a general look at the important lines:

[So many lines, so much value](https://preview.redd.it/cnrsj3ehy2n71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c95d5beb400d7024a6196736106457fd6c843879)

The most important level on here is the one I've labeled ""Launch #1"", though at this point the ""#1"" is looking smidgen unnecessary. First established on the gap-down on Oct. 6 of last year, it provided resistance on three occasions afterward (yellow arrows for the simpletons), with the last ending in a massive breakout to all-time highs.

The $9.08 line is the second most important line on the chart, in my possibly chromosome-deficient opinion. First established on Mar. 15 of this year after the bounce from all-time lows, it provided some level of resistance immediately afterward, but in the post *squeeze-that-wasn't-a-squeeze* world of the past few months it has become the ultimate resistance, a titanic, 700-foot wall of ice and sorrow towering over the pitiable bag holders huddling beneath its monstrously cold heights. Before this week, there were three prior attempts so surmount the Wall, all ending failure.

Of next and most immediate importance is the $8 mark. I have it as $7.94 as there is a small case for its origin story beginning on Mar. 25 of this year. However, like the $9 mark, its true importance has been found recently, and ***cannot be overstated***: This line, however pitiful, represents a **higher low** and thus holding that line is of critical importance for the prospects of any near-term upward action.

The orange downtrend line was the last of the downtrend lines, and crossing it resulted in the most recent attempt at the Wall of $9.

The green line is **the bottom**, a place of green pastures and buxom women, where the burdens of your bags will vanish away . . . because you've passed from this world and its worries.

&amp;#x200B;

Next is a chart looking at the $11.13 mark:

[Fibonacci, because Italian people](https://preview.redd.it/86tdxc76z2n71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b1f1e37ef85a53788c7100bddb17f9d64889a2)

As shown, the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $11.13 is shaping up to be a very important line. Indeed, it is soon to over shadow the $11.80 breakout line in that regard. On the dump following the June push, the ticker found support at $11.16 on Jun. 21, and subsequently it opened and dumped down from that level on a Jul. 6 (yellow arrows for simpletons). And just this week we saw the ticker reach up to **exactly** $11.13, before getting summarily thrown back off the top of the Wall. At this point, I think a breakout of $11.13 probably results in a significant push up. But we're getting well ahead of ourselves with that.

&amp;#x200B;

Being a TA wunderkind, I've turned my head to just the right angle and found a sliver of hope for the hopeless Men of the Watch:

[Two girls &amp; a cup: can't possibly fail](https://preview.redd.it/ary603egz2n71.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4e5b5f27b60656be73760dee5251e0e1d79e6b8)

The good news is it looks like a cup &amp; handle formation. The bad news is that *usually* a cup &amp; handle is a pause in an uptrend. Here, however, you have a downtrend into the cup (the giant pink arrow for the simpletons). This is a great example of Cbass's First Law of TA: You can always find a chart &amp; indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear. So, let's just call this a positive, because we have little else.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at 1hr chart, let's see if we can find some more copium:

[I see Higher Lows from my house!](https://preview.redd.it/dyaiz8hnz2n71.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f6ec421727eeedc62a68c18d33c86a25cd03e9d)

After the post earnings dump, CLOV briefly had a breakdown below the $8 support before rallying back up to test the $9 Wall, repeatedly. In that time, it found itself in a new channel between $8.40 and $8.60, thus establishing $8.40 as a **new, higher low**. This, as much as the Great YOLO Brigade of Labor Day Weekend, was the cause of the breakout on Tuesday. Basically, the chart was screaming that a breakout was incoming, YOLO brigade be damned.

The copium for next week is whether or not another higher low can be put in at $8.60. Like any good Man of the Bag Watch I have to hope it can, because if I try to leave, my portfolio gets hunted down and beheaded.

The worse and therefore more likely scenario is a breakdown all the way back to $8, undoing several weeks worth of upward progress. The absolute worst case is a *true* failure of $8 and a return to all-time lows. This would be a dagger in the heart, and unless someone knows a Red Woman, we're fucked.

In true Clovtard fashion, my knowledge of this company prior to purchasing shares was ""it does some techy stuff with healthcare."" Which, it turns out, is basically all you need to know. This company is one of those that seems complex and super high-tech, but in reality is more basic bitch than your average Instagram thot. That being said, it might still work out for them... after all, do you see some of these basic bitches that blow up on Instagram? Living proof that ***literally anything*** is possible.

But just in case someone cares (and to keep the Clovtards from reeing in the comments), here's a look at the company underlying the CLOV:

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Business Model***

* **TL;DR: they sell insurance to old people &amp; process payment claims from doctors**

Clover sell two products:

1. Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, which are just insurance plans for people on Medicare that include extra services along with the Medicare stuff, and
2. Direct Contracting (DC) plans, which are one of several alternative payment models recently put forth by CMS (the people that run Medicare)

The important difference between these is that Medicare Advantage is an insurance plan where the ***patient*** is Clover's customer and Direct Contracting is where the ***doctor*** is Clover's customer. With the latter, Clover is acting as, essentially, a *payment processor* for the doctor's Medicare patients. This allows Clover to get a sweet slice of that government largess. On the doctors' side of it, they deal with Clover instead of CMS. Supposedly the whole scheme (and this is one of five put forth by CMS in 2020) is supposed to save the government money (&gt;!it won't!&lt;). I don't give a fuck about that part; all I care about here is whether Clover can grow their slice of the pie. 

This Direct Contracting scheme was a ***major selling point*** for Chamath when they went public (more on that below), and for good reason. Clover only needs to manage a single relationship (with the doctor) to grab up dozens, or potentially hundreds, of patients. This DC scheme should be (*on paper at least)* far more efficient than Clover's original business model, which was just managing MA plans. 

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Growth***

* **TL;DR: they can** ***potentially*** \~**25x their customer base** **^((but probably much, much less))**

So other than **""the squeeze""**, why would anyone ***genuinely*** believe this company is going to have some astronomical valuation that would give them a stock price on par with the likes of United Healthcare? Simple: growth. 

Right now Clover only services MA and DC contracts in a small number of counties: 108 in 8 states. They are expected to nearly double with an additional 101 counties by the end of the year, bringing the total to 209 in 9 states. Since there are 3,000 some odd counties in the United States, there is (*on paper*) a lot of room to expand here. **This is good**.

As of their latest earnings report, they had 128,591 ""lives under management."" (I think that is a creepy as fuck way of putting it, but I *guess* it's industry standard....) Of those, 66,566 were MA customers and the remaining 62,025 were *indirect* patients, i.e., the Medicare patients of doctors in a DC agreement with Clover. The total of \~129,000 was a year-over-year increase of 126.3%. **This is also good**.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Math time!**

In their best counties, Clover has upward of 25% market share (at least this is their *claim*); that is, they have a quarter of the MA patients signed up with them. But to assume they can do that everywhere would be absurd. To keep this ultra simple, let's just assume that their current percentage as of the last earning report is representative of what they can do. So that is 128,591 ""lives"" across 108 counties which comes to an **average of 1,190 ""lives"" per county**.  (Obviously, not all counties are the same size, but let's just use this average for simplicity's sake.) So we have:

**1,190 x 3000 = 3.57 million ""lives""**

**3,570,000 / 128,591 = 27.8**

So, ***theoretically***, Clover could achieve **27.8x growth** in customers, and ***presumably*** a similar growth in revenue. (We'll get to profitability, or lack there of, below.) Looking deeper at this number, one thing going for it is that the number of old people is steadily increasing. But on the other hand, competition is a thing, and big thing in this space. To assume that Clover is going to have 3.5 million customers in 10 years, or even 20, is pretty wild..... 

Chamath claimed Clover was the ""easiest ten bagger"" he'd ever seen (or some shit like that). So, even going with that number, they would end up with 1.3 million ""lives"" in ten years. Even this seems pretty high to me. They went from 0 to 62,025 DC patients this year, but it is ***always easier to grow when you're small***. Scaling is an issue for all businesses. 

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Profitability***

* **TL;DR: they'll make no profit for a long ass time** **^((if ever))**

As for actually making money, well Clover doesn't do that. Yes, they had a 140% increase in revenue, which is good, but their expenses are rising ***faster*** than revenue. Accordingly, they missed on earnings by -0.52, or **378% downside surprise**. In typical corporate fashion, their forward guidance is full of claims of improvement on cost management just around the corner.

There is, to be fair here, a legitimate reason for some of the cost increases in the form of covid expenses. Essentially, some old people needed extra care, while others *delayed* care until it looked safe which caused a massive spike in trips to the doctor. And when you're old and you let shit slide, it gets a lot worse and a lot more expensive.

Furthermore, their basic strategy involves eating losses when they take on new ""lives under management,"" with the idea that they'll make it back, and more, further down the road with that same patient though the efficiencies of their ""A.I."", Clover Assistant.  

Taking them at their word that this works (and will continue to do so at larger scales) then it is obvious they will being eating losses for years to come. Allegedly, they'll turn a profit in 2023, but I wouldn't hold my breath on that. However, just growing their ""lives under management"" number might be enough to hold up the stock price.

It might **not** be enough, however, to keep the lights on. If they can't at least slow the bleeding, share issuances could be lurking down the road (queue the pump &amp; dump conspiracies).

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Competition***

* **TL;DR: they have to take market share from better companies**

As noted above, the biggest hurdle in front of Clover is **competition**. Despite the ""tech start-up"" narrative surrounding Clover, the reality is that they are marching into the teeth of well-entrenched healthcare companies. 

The likes of United Healthcare and Humana aren't going to take lightly to little ol' Clov rolling up in their shit. With about 10 million patients between them, UH and Humana are monsters in the Medicare space and with that comes the ability to undercut the competition. Furthermore, all these big players also have their own ***magic AI machine-learning gizmos*** that do ***magic AI things***. And they already have access to more data than Clover on account of their massive patient base. 

This doesn't mean they can just snuff Clover out of existence, but taking away market share from established players is a far different gambit than expanding into a new market. And it gets harder the bigger you get. 

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Shaddy Shit***

* **TL;DR: Chamath is a shaddy af, and so is the CEO**

This whole shabang was rolled out in typical Chamath fashion. Back in October of 2020, in his pitch for Clover, he claimed they **""already""** had 200,000 lives under management in their **Direct Contracting program** (i.e., not including the MA patients). Except that was bullshit of the Chamath-degree. At the time he claimed this, Clover ***hadn't even started*** its DC program (it had only just been accepted into the program). 

As their latest earning report notes, they don't expect to get anymore ""lives"" in their DC program until Jan. 2022. (This is due to Medicare enrollment period rules). So, rather than ""already"" having 200,000 for 2021, Clover will instead end the year with the \~62,000 that they have right now. ***Chamath at his finest, ladies and gentlemen.***

Clover's top guy, Vivek, is also well-known for being shaddy. Though, in his case, I don't actually care as much. Back in the day, this guy ran three hospitals in NJ that were noteworthy for having the highest fees of any hospitals in America. Shaddy, but shaddy in the ***ruthless capitalism direction***. He gets a pass from Cbass *for this*. He is also alleged to have pilfered a company he ran back in the day. This doesn't get a pass, because it could negatively affect my bottom line. 

Clover is the subject of two ***related*** investigations, one from DoJ and the other from the SEC. The DoJ one is about shaddy business practices; something about kickbacks. I also don't give much a fuck about this. The SEC investigation is about the fact that the DoJ investigation was not disclosed during the SPAC merger. All this will probably amount to some fines, if anything at all. 

On scale of 0 to Enron, I'll give Clover a 1.5. Doesn't look that bad to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Technology***

* **TL;DR: they have a magic AI app that designed to maximize** **~~health~~** ***profits*** **^((maybe))**

The last thing to mention is the Great Green Hope: the **Clover Assistant**. This is the ""tech"" in Clover and the reason dipshits are using #TelsaHealth. What is it? Well, basically a data input and analysis program. More basically: *Microsoft Excel with fancy buttons*.

Clover Assistant is used by the doctors (and many MA patients use it, too) to coordinate and recommend stuff. The Great Hope here is that doctors love using this thing so much that they'll sign onto a DC agreement with Clover, allowing Clover to process their Medicare payment claims in exchange for access to the ""**app**"".

So is it going to work? Well, it is ***starting*** to: Clover went from 0 to 62,000 patients via this scheme this year. It's a country fucking mile from what Chamath claimed, but ain't nothing. And given the potential for expansion into the rest of the US, and you have the receipt for a pretty damn good return on capital. But then again, it is just an ""app"".

To be clear, I don't hate the *idea* of Clover Assistant. Conceptually, I actually like it. The Clover Assistant basically helps doctors make sure their patients are getting the ""right care"" by compiling data and presenting it in an easy to use fashion. This is presented as an opportunity to ""improve outcomes"" and ""save costs"" and ""help the under-served."" But I don't give a rat's ass about any of that.

Which brings me to the Hindenburg report, and the part about it that I ***like***. The report claims that Clover is using the Assistant to direct doctors toward medical recommendations that would result in profits for Clover (rather than the best medical outcome), and that they are incentivizing the doctors with increased payments for these outcomes. ***I love this.*** Now, Clover vehemently denies this is the case, but I (not so) secretly hope their lying here, because this is ***exactly*** what I imagine when I think of applying Big Data-A.I. and Machine Learning to healthcare.   

People have ***blind faith*** in machines, particularly ones that they've been told are ""**A.I. powered**"" and involve ""**machine learning**"". Thus, you can use the concept of ""A.I."" to persuade patients to just accept whatever the computer tells them. Machine learning is then used program the Clover Assistant to ***maximize profits***, which should involve providing the minimum care required to keep the patient alive as long as possible. (Medicare pays a set amount to Clover and they get to keep the extra if the patients don't use up all the funds). 

The only way I could see to improve on this diabolical scheme would be if they ground up the corpses of their newly deceased patients, turned them into food and fed them to the rest of their **""lives under management.""** I'm lookin' for every penny here, kids, ***every single penny***.

**Part 3. A Conspiracy of Idiocy**

Typical of any stock ticker that gathers a cultish following, the Clovidiots are as well-known for their conspiracy theories as they are for their options expiring worthless. Now, most of these are the run-of-mill shit you get with any ticker: the Hedgies, reeee! You would think that this is the first time some of these people had ever bought a stock... oh, wait.

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Hedgies!!!***

* **TL;DR: it's the stock market, deal with it**

So, do the ""Hedge Funds"" manipulate the stock price? Well, sure, why not. They definitely shorted it, and then managed to cover those short sales with little appreciable rise in the stock. Back in June, CLOV was at something like a 48% shorted. Now the it's 15% and I believe it got as low as 7% before this week's run up. While going from 48% to 7% short with no appreciable rise in the stock price looks impossible, it's definitely not when you considered that a large percentage of the float has been in institutional hands this whole time. Stock goes up a little, they sell and back down she goes, welcome to a regular day on the stock market.

Is this some grand conspiracy of fat cats in a room smoking cigars as they plan out how to stick it to those pesky Reddit kids? ***I doubt it***, but if it makes you feel better, whatever.

I, personally, would worry less about the ""Hedge Funds"" and more about the Market Makers, as they're the ones selling you the options, and if they buy up the stock beforehand, they can sell out for a profit while simultaneous vaporizing those call options you bought from them. In fact, I'm pretty sure this is the game.

Can anything be done about it? Well, no, not really. At least, not unless retail buys up a larger percentage of the float. However, with each false run up, I wonder if that exact process is taking place, i.e., more bagholders are being newly minted, and each, not wanting to take an L and just move on with his life, decides to become a ""diamond handed ape."" Only time will reveal the truth of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Us vs. the World***

* **TL;DR: everyone thinks this way, deal with it**

The second great conspiracy of CLOV is that the whole of the internet is out to get it. This is proffered with the full knowledge that GME-Anon and Popcorn ***both believe the same thing about their own stock.*** Both also believe that CLOV is, ***in and of itself***, a conspiracy to distract from their pet stock. But GME-Anon ***also believes*** that Popcorn is an engineered distraction. And all three are ***also*** convinced that the Mods are out to get them, ***specifically***.

This is, of course, perfectly normal behavior. That might seem shocking to some of you, but the next time you're watching football with a die hard fan (or whatever lame-ass europoor sport you watch), look for their reactions whenever the slightest thing doesn't go their way:

* *""These fucking refs are terrible! They're totally biased against my team! They've got it out for us! I'm going to write an angry letter to the league!""*

Sound familiar? It should, because if you look around with open eyes, you'll find this exact behavioral pattern repeated at infinitum across every conceivable human endeavor.

Do people hate CLOV and the masses of idiots holding it? Sure, and I don't blame them. You guys can be pretty fucking annoying. That does not, however, equate to a grand conspiracy of suppression. The fact that your copy-pasta DD got nixed just like everyone else's lazy dogshit copy-pasta is not you being singled out. It's you not understanding the rules and adapting your behavior to play within them. But hey, maybe it's easier to just blame the Mods.

**Part 4. Rise now, a Man of the Bag Watch**

Having taken a brief tour of Castle Black and had a bit of a feel for what it's like to be a venerable Man of the Clov Bag Watch, most of you are probably thinking: *Okay, how the fuck do I get out this chickenshit operation?* 

Well, you are probably still hoping for **moon**. In that regard, I've some bad news for you: ***there will be no squeeze.*** 

There will absolutely not be a **short squeeze****.** At 15% short, there is zero chance of this happening. *""But, bruh, the* ***real*** *short number is like 420% bruh.""* Bullshit. Just straight bullshit.

There is also not going to be a **gamma squeeze.** Not anytime soon, and likely never. In order to get a gamma squeeze you need options that are going to be delta-hedged. But why delta-hedge options that are going to be Thanos-snapped out of existence by expiry?

A while back, it looked like there could be a **mixed squeeze** (short covering + gamma hedging), but that's all in the past now. Down the road from now, could it still happen? Yeah, sure, and I could end up raw-dogging a Victoria's Secret model on the hood of my new lambo. All kinds of crazy things are ***possible***, but that doesn't make them ***likely***.

And honestly, what the fuck is wrong with a good ol' grind up? Squeezes are fun, I get it. You get to see your money double, triple, 5x, 10x, all in the space of a day or two. You get to see those option YOLO's gain a thousand of percent in minutes. But you still make money on a grind up. A fuckload of it.

I'm not sure I buy into this whole notion of a ""squeeze"" being the **Holy Grail of the Stock Market**. It's starting to sound like the Bears and their perpetual claims that they're going to make ***all the money*** on the coming collapse, all while lighting round after round of SPY puts on fire. The Squeeze Fanatics are doing the same thing, but with call options on meme stocks. 

But, hey, what do I know? I'm just peon in this operation, a pitifully small cog in the great meat grinder we call the stock market. For now the chart tells me there's still **hope of up**, and so my bag watch continues. When the chart dies and there is no more good to be said of the company, then I will initiate my Bagholder Optimization Formula and there my watch will end. Until then, I man my post.

Listen up!  Im about to present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 75x your money**.** Too much, or too good to be true?  Im being conservative. Hear me out.   

**First, I shall Flex:**  

1) I am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I can't figure it out, I know who to ask. 

2) I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.  

Why flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing matters just a little.  With that said, once more, listen up! 

**The Pickle:** 

You youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is, there is NO effective treatment. 

The FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has significant adverse events.  The risk of brain swelling requires serial Brain MRIs.  It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k.  Most incredible is that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make later).

Again, for emphasis, the FDA still approved it because the need is that severe.  President Biden recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation over a trillion dollars.

**The Fix:  $SAVA**

Cassava Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive function in its CMS trial.  The degree and duration of improvement have NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic. It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.  

Yes, we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc.  A genuine criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.  

Without getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere criticisms is Phase 3 trials.  There is no valid argument against this statement.  This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use absolute phrases.  If you take away only one point from this article, then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more about him later).  Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy.  Be angry, fellow apes, be angry.   Im just getting started, BTW.

Do market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal? They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the first place.

**The Villan and His Massacre:**

Jordan Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a ""Citizens Petition."" A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit) out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.   

Essentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second, sold their shares.  SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog (https://ad-science.org/), Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.  

1) Jordan Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that patients are literally dying as they wait.  WTF!? Why, why why??  If you aren't angry, somethings wrong with you.  JT states he is concerned for patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected, JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly. In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that is the \*only\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is horrendous (3% success rate)?  Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD in its purest form.  

2) Then why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my position by 30%.  With that said, Im not surprised the masses started selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent, it's an \*opportunity\*—a second chance to buy the stock on clearance. 

**The Financials:**

$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue. 

Fifty million patients are suffering from AD globally.  6 million of those patients reside in the US.  Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs $20k annually, just a bit over a third  the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's soon to fail drug):

1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000

That calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment options).  The current stock price is $50.  The overly conservative valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750

The above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia. 

**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**

If you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment. Thats devastating for patients, but families?  It's not uncommon for families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they ""can't handle it anymore."" This market is massive and unaddressed!  Severely, painfully, and gravely unaddressed.  

I have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process.  JT is only the face of this farce.  Behind him are many short positions making a 100 million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their short-term gain.  There is something far more concerning.

**The Plot Thickens:**

What I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or short-term price action.  There is something much more sinister.  Biogen has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved.  Now it is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a problem:

FDA advisory committee voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently, a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's AD drug.  This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no other therapy on the market.  Well, what happens if a new, more effective medication shows up?  

**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**

Back to our Villian JT.  JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the initial ""Citizens Patetion"") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works.  Why?  I speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer.  There is little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less.  When that happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug.  Biogen already has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to rejuvenate the companies earnings.  Then expediently and as expected, Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.

I believe that is the root issue.  Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam!  A group of us have gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).

**Short term price action:**

1) Im expecting the SP to bounce.  After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a perfect overreaction play.  If you dont know what Im talking about, you can look up ""overreaction with reversion to the mean.""

2) Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within ""weeks to months.""  

3) Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks.  (""Soon"" per Remi)

4) Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.

\#SAVA's float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted with utilization of &gt;90%.  It'll take very little to make SAVA move, big.  Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.  

I have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on SAVA.  My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!).  I'll finish with one last piece of advice.  Over 19 years of investing, my most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further propagated by ""experts"" tweeting and commenting with their hidden agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual published results, but apparently, her opinion counts?  Comments of her blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, ""oh, he sounds smart, so he must be right."" or ""That sounds complicated, he must be on to something.""  In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical details are fooling many.   DFV saw something well before masses, and he was paid handsomely for it.

That was an exhilarating feeling watching that percent gain go up in real time.  

I know nobody has a crystal ball, but what is the general consensus about how the SPY will perform this coming week? I made my biggest, non day-trade, options purchase Friday. (Big for me) I bought 10 Sep. 30 2021 460 calls at an average of .46 each. I think that specific option closed at .30 (Proof of position below) I feel OK about my entry, but what will I need to happen to make say 100% profit on it before expiration? If the SPY reverses and tests 460 next week, will I be in the green on that trade?

As a pre-cursor - This post is not intended to be too much about the fundamental basics of the company. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pmaxlb/auph_best_treatment_against_lupus_nephritis_still/) was posted here and did a pretty good job of that. Basically, they have a new standard of care drug that is saving lives in a rare disease. 

Also, I am not a financial advisor, yada yada, this is not financial advice, yada yada standard disclaimer.

Now that you’re current if you read the link, let’s get this thing going.

Aurinia is in a very special spot right now. As many of you may know, we are headed into triple witching week (simply put, the expiration of stock options, stock index futures, and stock index options all fall on the same day), this only happens four times a year and makes stocks very volatile.

Why does this make Auph special? While, for this week alone [Auph already has 27k options that are ITM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AUPH/options?date=1631836800&amp;p=AUPH), if you include the [October calls, its 68k options ITM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AUPH/options?date=1634256000&amp;p=AUPH). 

What's really important is when you notice that they are on the precipice of $20. As they cross $20, another 25.5k options come into the money. At $25 another 33k options come into the money from both September and October. Most stocks, especially Auph, do not attract this much out of the money buying volume, especially one week until expiration. 

So what happened?

Usually, you can look at this and assume a whale or someone leaked something and a move higher is coming. Many figure this is the case as 2 weeks back, a bit over 40k call options were purchased in 2 days. Why? Possibly because for multiple reasons there is speculation a buyout is coming ([pr about a buyout resulting in firings](https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/21/08/22676683/aurinia-pharma-shares-up-3-7-following-earlier-press-release-from-co-disclosing-it-entered-deal-to-b), delisting from tsx, and multiple articles whisperings for months in reputable newspapers about buyout negotiations).

That all being said, this puts the stock in a special spot. [**Referencing this post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz8mgr/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)**, on the basics of how a gamma squeeze works,** if auph crosses 20$ on Monday morning, it should begin a gamma ramp. This process creates a runaway effect when the next set of available options also has a large OI. For example, as Auph crosses $20, MMs begin to cover their calls more aggressively as they begin to come into the money, meaning they will buy more shares. As they buy more shares, the stock price will raise, as the stock price raises, they will need to buy more shares. This is compounded especially when the next option has a large OI. With the massive OI on both September and October $20 and $25 calls, a gamma squeeze would be huge and could possibly even put the $25s in the money by the end of the week.

As a precursor to all of this, I rode GME, from 10 to 400 ( go back and check [my comment history](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/gfbe9hx?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) if you don’t believe me). No one really talks about it, but it was a gamma squeeze before it was a short squeeze. Auph, while not GME sits in a similar position. Over the past month during their run. They have not seen even a 1% change in short interest (current short interest is 17% of float). So after a gamma squeeze, there very well could still exist a chance for a short squeeze. 

**TLDR:** Due to a massive option OI, Aurinia is ripe for a gamma squeeze **sending it much higher**. If it crosses 20, it could easily see 25. If it crosses 25, it will likely keep a runaway effect.

**As a last note:** 

All of this becomes moot if Aurinia is bought out before Monday morning or before calls expire at the end of the week. At this point, I would highly suggest looking to the XBI, and strong biotech tickers like MYOV (Shameless plug, but is currently undergoing a share buying program from the main owner that took it from about 20 to 27 and is only halfway complete, has a deal with PFE for $4.2b, and 3 standard of care approved indications), as well as some other strong biotech stocks that stand potential to surge in the case of AUPH money flowing to other tickers after a buyout (This happened after $TRIL buyout as well).  

My positions: 

Auph: 0 shares, 260 calls. September $20, $25, and $30. October $20 and $25.

Myov: 22,500 shares. 210 calls, spread dates and strikes.

Maybe I’m retarded but when gme was at 5$ and r/deepfuckingvalue posted they called him retarded too and he’s worth 20 million now.

I just want to know if someone can do it better.

**Prediction:**

Personally, I'm banking on a quick crash of 30%-40% of the overall market followed by a lengthy recovery time.

With the public consciousness being aware of the rapid inflation, the Great Resignation, the ending of the eviction moratorium, rising tensions within and out of the country, scrambled supply lines accompanied with mass shortages, and blah-blah-blah, I think a lot of investors have their fingers hovering over the sell button. This, along with the addition of short sellers ready to dogpile on the beginning of a downward trend, should result in a sharp decline in several securities' prices. However, unlike the Covid-19 crash, I do not believe we'll experience a quick bull rally after the market bottoms out.

The flash crash of 2020 was driven by the fear of an unknown virus and the suspicion of an overdue recession, but once heavy government intervention was in place, investors had their confidence restored. This time around, the U.S. is facing a likely default on it's debt and dealing with almost irreparable internal economic problems, and the general confidence in our institutions has greatly withered since then. I think America's government is very limited with how it can intervene and I have trouble seeing the market whales and many retail traders easily jumping right back in after any announcement has been made; leading to a prolonged stagnation.

Now, I am certainly not a professional in market predictions or knowing what the hell the powers that be can do alter markets. I'm just someone who likes trading and has been keeping up with the news. You should take this prediction with a FISTFUL of salt.

**My Plan:**

Sadly, my broker restricts much of what I can do (no naked options, no covered puts, no margin account for options, etc.), which restricts how much I can grow my account. Nevertheless, I worked a way around these rules and plan for a FAT gain.

With that said, I want to combine my money with borrowed cash from friends/family (people who are outside the market) and a personal loan, plus whatever my brokerage will give me in my margin account. Estimated leverage should be roughly x3.5. After gathering the capital, I will short the ever-loving shit out of SPXL (a 3x leverage ETF of the SP500) and use the new founded cash along with some of the account's original capital to buy ATM puts. Next, using a majority of the remaining capital, I'll buy shares of SPXS (a 3x leverage inverse ETF of the SP500) and sell deep OTM calls because of the increased volatility due to panic selling. What's left of the account will be spent on ATM calls of SPXS.

I chose SPXL and SPXS for the fact they follow the very stable and predictable SP500, but with more bang for their buck. I know WSB isn't known for it's safer gambles, but with the increased risk of using so much borrowed money and a falling market, I needed something to sound somewhat safe and reasonable to place the bet.

If this portion of the plan fails, all I have to simply do is consolidate all my debt and then become Wendy's personal bitch boy for the better portion of my life, reflecting on where I went wrong as I shovel grease into the mouths of meatbags. If this portion of the plan succeeds, then after paying back the principle and one to two month's worth of interest (how long I think the decline will last), I should obtain a return of at least x10.

***NOTE:*** *i failed math class. number may vary.*

Next up is the stagnation period of the crash. I will be taking some of the gains out of the brokerage account lock in my win. The rest will be scaled into discounted stocks (likely blue chips with decent dividend yields and leveraged ETFs). On top of scaling in, selling iron condors would also be considered. If it turns out that the economy will undergo another v-shaped recovery like last time, I'll kiss goodbye to most of my winnings, but still make it out with a profit.

**Questions:**

Anyone got a better alternative for taking advantage of the market crash without going full retard and yoloing your mortgage in deep OTM Tesla calls expiring in six minutes? Am I overlooking an opportunity or flaw in my plan? Did you even bother reading all of the post? Is everyone still holding onto GME?

**TL;DR:**

I'm certainly not a doomer (or god forbid, a gay bear), but I do recognize crashes do happen and I just want to utilize extreme leverage to make a hefty gain after it's all said and done. But I do struggle to make five bucks on a ten thousand dollar account, so what the fuck do I know.",True,False,False,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,10823597,public,confidence,self,Does anyone have a game plan for the market crash?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pmlgli/does_anyone_have_a_game_plan_for_the_market_crash/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I posted this as a comment in the daily and I was encouraged to make it into a post so here you go.

There are basically two parts of the cycle which seem to play out over a few months.  The pump phase is pretty clear.

#Pump Phase

Key features are momentum, hype, and ""new recruits / fresh money"" who keep buying at the relative top.  IV tends to be elevated.  


Apes and FOMOers are buying lots of calls.  IMO calls are quite risky unless you buy small amounts and feel very confident about timing a retracement dip.

CC's and short puts are fairly safe money.  I actually prefer CC's provided you have enough margin to keep naked calls open.  This allows you to dump the shares and flip sides quickly when the trend reverses very strongly.  With short puts you can do a sort of reverse CC, but you need to short shares to hedge if it reverses.  But IMO this is a bit more dangerous because when there is a reversal it is typically more rapid than a decline.

#Dump Phase

Characterized by slow bleed or sideways shuffle as IV gradually trends downward.  ""New money"" is not infinite, when there is a brief pause, people are hesitant to stay in or buy.  Writing options are way less lucrative and there's a lot less room to hedge and react appropriately.  In this phase there are two ways to effectively play this IMO.

Try to time the bottom with cheap calls.  Eg. GME at $150 showed very bullish indicators of a strong reversal.  If a seemingly strong support is broken decisively you can hedge by shorting shares and create a synthetic put.  Alternatively if it's not seeming to approach a bottom any time soon, get cheap puts and convert to synthetic calls instead if there's a reversal.

Finally, ONE HUGE important note.  Have access to extended hours, preferably 4am to 8pm all the way.  This is necessary to hedge properly, it creates additional safety and ability to manage risk.

Here's a great short video explaining the entire premise of the uranium trade: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iItpKh4bjds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iItpKh4bjds)

Thought the gains in AMC and GME were big? With the Sprott Trust, the average retail trader is able to finally move the price of uranium. A market, that has traditionally been a limited hangout and highly illiquid has been opened up to everyone.

Since the opening of the Sprott Trust, about $300M flowed into the trust, raising the uranium price from $30 to $40 a pound. Now, Sprott's reloaded $1.3B into their ATM. If a measly $300M moved the price that much, think of what $1.3B implies. You do the math.

Uranium is a cyclical trade that sees a bull market roughly every 20 years or so. The last bull market peaked in 2007 with a $140 uranium. Literally over 3x where we are now, not taking into account inflation, all the money that's in the system now, the networking effect of the internet that we have today, and Sprott Trust vehicle that allows the retail investor to pile in and squeeze the price. $140 uranium all of sudden seems bearish.

**And that's not even the best part.**

As the price of the Sprott Trust goes up, the price of uranium goes up.

As the price of uranium goes up, the price of **the uranium miners go up multiples higher. The BIG play is the leverage that the uranium miners have to the price of uranium. So if the price of uranium goes up 5x from here, the miners can move 10x, 15x, 20x, and in some cases 100x from here.**

Right now, the combined market cap of all the uranium miners is $35B...that's it. **Yes, all the uranium miners in the space have a smaller combined market cap than a shit coin. Do you see how explosive this trade is??**

To recap, the inflows of money are as follows:

Sprott Uranium Trust =&gt; Uranium Spot Price = &gt; Large Cap Uranium Miners  =&gt; Mid Cap Miners =&gt; Small Cap.

Don't know which miners to buy? Consider some of the ETFs. Otherwise just take a basket of uranium miner stocks and enjoy the ride.

And finally, **this isn't a short term in and out trade, where we trade in and out. We stay in the trade and watch the Sprott price rise, and thus our miners rise. This is a mid-term ride (2+ years), so enjoy the ride and enjoy your 10, 20, and 100 baggers.**

Right now, the combined market cap of all the uranium miners is $35B...that's it. **Yes, all the uranium miners in the space have a smaller combined market cap than a shit coin. Do you see how explosive this trade is??**

To recap, the inflows of money are as follows:

Sprott Uranium Trust =&gt; Uranium Spot Price = &gt; Large Cap Uranium Miners (eg., PALAF, NXE, UUUU) =&gt; Mid Cap Miners (eg., UUUU, URG, FCUUF) =&gt; Small Cap (eg., CUR, AGE).

Don't know which miners to buy? Consider the ETF URNM, which has been the best performing uranium ETF in the last year. Otherwise just take a basket of uranium miner stocks and enjoy the ride.

And finally, **this isn't a short term in and out trade, where we trade in and out. We stay in the trade and watch the Sprott price rise, and thus our miners rise. This is a mid-term ride (2+ years), so enjoy the ride and enjoy your 10, 20, and 100 baggers.**

For me, we are currently in a classic Wyckoff reaccumulation phase firmly in phase D (trend within range). I strongly believe we will be retesting the $60-$65 region in the coming weeks and potentially breaking out above the prior ATH after that. The test of this region will provide further clues are to where this market is going. My target for the next leg up if we breakout above the prior ATH is around $300-$400. Mental stop loss below $40 (sorry permabulls I’m not riding this into the grave if the trade goes south).

GME

GME is at the end of a HUGE flag, high and tight. It is the biggest I have ever seen in my trading career. According to Bulkowski’s research, these technical patterns boast a 93% success rate once breakout is confirmed (not confirmed yet). This pattern is easier to see on the log scale and I’ve drawn 2 potential breakout points around $230 and $270. Volume is drying up and we are going to breakout soon. My target for the next leg up if we breakout above the prior ATH is between 4k-8k. Mental stop loss below the last point of support below $145.

**Part 3 – Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**

**Part 4 – Recent Updates**

**Part 5 – Financials and Valuation**

**Part 6 – Bear Case**

**Part 8 – TL;DR**

**Part 1 – Introduction**

It was a warm Monday morning on August 23rd almost a month back, when seemingly for no reason – **GOEV shot up from ~$5.9 to ~$8, a 30% gain on the day.** The next day – GME popped, for a 30% gain as well, with AMC and BB also making up big gains, leading to the ‘meme mania’ we’ve been experiencing for the last couple of weeks. 

Why’d this happen? Well there were no company/industry catalysts. The only event that seemed to occur in the prior week was the expiration of monthly options. One of the theories going around is that there’s an almost quarterly cycle going on at this point where FTD’s are leading to a surge in prices in the next cycle for ‘meme stocks’ which tend to be heavily shorted for the most part. How accurate this is I have no clue and whether this applies to GOEV I don’t know, haven’t investigated that particular theory but there’s plenty of posts/comments floating around for you to look into if you’re so inclined. 

The quick point I’m trying to make here is that if a heavily shorted stock is popping 30% in a day, with no major catalyst for the industry or the company in question – and that company is now advancing towards realizing its major milestones with favorable tailwinds expected for the sector, it could pop a lot more than 30% in the months to come. **GOEV is among the youngest EV companies - having been around for less than 5 years, with arguably the most unique vehicles coming out (on schedule – seems to be pretty amazing in the EV space) that very few, if any, of the established or other up and coming competitors are producing, and has been shorted more it seems – for the failure of its peers than any real fault of its own.**

**Part 2 – Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**

* From an investment into equities point of view – S&amp;P 500 has fallen about 0.5%, on average, during the month of September. Stocks have tended to go up, on average, during every other month — other than a slight dip in February — over the past half century [link]( https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/investing/stock-market-september/index.html). However, this may soon be coming to an end as in the past week Investors stampeded into stocks and out of cash as global equity funds witnessed their biggest inflows since March 2021 while large-cap U.S. funds enjoyed a record haul, a weekly round-up by BofA showed. [link](https://www.investing.com/news/economy/monster-reallocations-to-stocks-as-us-tax-threat-recedes--bofa-2619022) 

* Let’s take a look at the EV market dynamics and upcoming catalysts before getting into GOEV specifically, so we get a high-level understanding of the bigger picture. The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021 [source]( https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/electric-vehicle-market). By 2027, $1.007 trillion by 2027 which is an average of 2 sources - [source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/electric-vehicle-market-analysis-size-regional-outlook-competitive-strategies-and-forecasts-to-2027-2021-07-12?tesla=y), [source 2](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-market-size-to-be-valued-at-1-212-1-billion-by-2027-owing-to-rising-number-of-government-initiatives-globally-to-promote-manufacturing--adoption-of-evs--million-insights-301238118.html), , another source actually has the market valued at $2.5 trillion but it’s a bit of an outlier compared to the other 2 [source 3](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/11/2227050/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html).   

* Global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. [link](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html) 

* In November 2018, an article came out stating that the number of EVs on U.S. roads was projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. Annual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. About 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure. [link]( https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx). 

* As it turns out, that number of annual EV sales of 3.5 million vehicles in 2030 was revised to almost double of that in a November 2020 report, just 2 years after the previous article. The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. Over 90% of states offered incentives for setting up EV charging infrastructure, with meaningful quality of life incentives and exemptions are offered across 39 states in the US, including easier payment plans for the purchase of EVs, limited-time incentives to accelerate EV adoption/conversion and lack of requirements for emission inspections across several states. [link]( https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)

* President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 [link 1](https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/40-percent-evs-2030/), [link 2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-set-target-50-evs-by-2030-industry-backs-goal-2021-08-05/) which is double of the 20% forecast just three years earlier in 2018, and would likely occur only with strong support on the supply side through infrastructural and other support that would enable EV manufacturers to develop the capacity to produce the target number of vehicles, and demand side with respect to incentivizing people to purchase EVs. 

* EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. This bill adds $4,500 to the current $7,500 tax credit available for a total of $12,500 potentially available to EV buyers. Internal Revenue Code Section 30D provides a tax credit to any person who purchased a qualifying EV during the year. It includes passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The proposal calls for $160 billion to fund subsidies and purchase incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ev-tax-credit-bill-biden/) 

* The proposed EV credits in the budget blueprint would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase. In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs. The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/11/us-democrats-propose-dramatic-expansion-of-ev-tax-credits-that-favors-big-three.html) 

* Furthermore, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, titled the American Jobs Plan, includes billions of dollars for other electrification efforts and for a national charging network. Specifically, the bipartisan plan includes $7.5 billion for a network of EV charging stations across the country. It also includes another $7.5 billion for electric buses and other transportation methods. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/biden-infrastructure-ev-subsidies-charging-network/)  

* States area also providing EV incentives to residents e.g. Gov. JB Pritzker signed Illinois’ clean energy law which includes a $4,000 rebate for residents to buy an electric vehicle (EV). [link](https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/illinois-wants-to-give-you-4000-to-buy-an-electric-vehicle/). 

* By 2030, there’s expected to be an 8% divergence between EV demand estimates and production plans, meaning there needs to be a massive scaling up of infrastructure/capacity of EV manufacturers over current projections in order to fill the gap in the market.

**Part 2 – Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**

**Before we look into what’s happened since my last post, let’s go over a quick refresher on what the company does.** Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 650 employees [link](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/65/canoo-receives-initial-aa-esg-leader-rating-from-msci) from leading technology and automotive companies [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/). Canoo’s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else’s lineup… take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=1747). What makes this Canoo so special compared to other EVs is their modular platform, which is purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. 

It is this modular platform that led to Apple’s interest and having talks with Canoo (the talks are assumed to have fallen apart because Canoo was looking for an investor while Apple was looking to make an acquisition), as the platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car’s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).

Apple wasn’t the only major company interested in Canoo, Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai and Kia’s parent company) actually went a lot farther than Apple did with Canoo, announcing a partnership in February 2020 to develop new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by Canoo [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). This was extremely unusual and referred to as a significant victory for Canoo, as ‘pretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal… Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of 2017, when its founders started the company’ [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). 

Ultimately this partnership did not go ahead because Canoo’s chairman didn’t feel as though it was worth it for Canoo, saying that the original deal with Hyundai didn’t factor in the value of Canoo’s IP, so a shift in strategy was made from licensing out the technology to protecting the IP and manufacturing and selling Canoo’s own vehicles to commercial operators [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev) 

Regarding the technology/IP - Canoo has developed the world’s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the lifestyle vehicle, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo’s suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video).

Let’s take a look at the current automotive model and see how Canoo’s approach and the use of the skateboard platform add so much more value than conventional ICE manufacturers [link](https://gyazo.com/041f5f426804ab087740da6c5b0b1aeb), currently the model is broken because 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit is only generated after the first owner. The current model is geared towards the first owner and nothing more, with an assortment of OEMs/spare parts retailers/3rd party installers servicing vehicles after the initial sale. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same [link](https://gyazo.com/272959d52f3e8c169c711e9b18dbd98c). 

The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions [link](https://gyazo.com/7ade9dac03f0e6fcbffc6b8f3942eb4c), with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo’s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next. It’s also worth pointing out that in traditional ICE, it would be exceptional if Bill of Materials cost carryover across variants reached 25%, with Canoo, this is exceeding 50%. The specific savings include:

* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed

* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants

* &gt;70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.

These enable the development of space efficient cabins that integrate simply onto platform [link](https://gyazo.com/0a5777ed4387d9d9916a0c0d949f452e), and provide the key basis for engineering Canoo’s new value proposition of having a harmonized and articulated 3 – layer vehicle concept that keeps fresh and returns capital over an entire vehicle lifecycle [link](https://gyazo.com/7992fbead2e3c724ec002333b8c909c8). This image also showcases how Canoo aims to capture the full vehicle lifecycle value [link](https://gyazo.com/ca0abdaece1006dbb34ad42b60bb2977) 

The three vehicles that Canoo has publicly announced as part of its lineup are:

Lifestyle vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/) - Fully electric, highly versatile and offering more utility inside and out for city explorers, businesses, families and adventurers. The multi-purpose platform unlocks SUV-size interior space on a smaller exterior footprint. It’s pretty hard to put into an image of the vehicle into words so I’d recommend clicking on the above link to check it out for yourself. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):

* Launching late 2022.

* Starting at $34,750*

* 2 seats - 5 seats - 7 seats

* 250 mi range

* Up to 350 Horsepower 

* 28min charge time 80%

Multi-purpose Delivery Vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) – Business ready vehicle that lowers the total cost of ownership while providing easy maintenance. More cargo in a small footprint to enable easy maneuverability. A productivity tool that enables you to plug in your tools and get to work. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):

* Starting at $33,000*

* 200 ft³ - 500 ft³ cargo volume

* 130 – 230 mi, 90 – 190 mi range (EPA)

* 1,540 to 1,980 lbs

Pickup [link](https://www.canoo.com/pickup/) – All Electric, All American, All Utility - The Pickup Truck is built to be the new standard in function, form and utility — ready for work and the weekend. The picup truck is as strong as the toughest trucks out there and includes features for people who use trucks on the job, weekend, and adventure. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):

* Launching as early as 2023.

* Price – Not currently listed, but during the Q&amp;A portion of the investor day portion on June 30th, somebody asked what the base pricing for the pickup was, given that the Ford lightning F-150 base price was being advertised at $32,000. Chairman Tony Aquila said Canoo was not prepared to announce the pricing at that time, but Canoo would not be beaten in this category – you can check it out at the following link [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=10908)  

* Targeted HP – 500+

* Payload Capacity – 1800 lbs

* Range – 200+ mi

* Powertrain – AWD or RWD

There’s actually a fourth vehicle as well that hasn’t been listed anywhere officially but was found by /u/Mcardiel007 when he was having issues communicating with Canoo and went to their Torrance location and spotted them unloading what is potentially the new sedan. All credits to him/her for the following pictures [pic 1](https://gyazo.com/5e84005c8399352f2de9efbedeb3d933), [pic 2](https://gyazo.com/608a14d42df52284544bfbf0cf4a2912?token=1800737b805fc34222e29805d032b29c), [pic 3](https://gyazo.com/906b46f350bed3e4ed10357422bf548a), [pic 4](https://gyazo.com/5dd4b620f07fcb72fdb2234dfc35a36a), [pic 5](https://gyazo.com/83e23a1219e08bd6a2d118138121a714). 

We can see that Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup). One of the fastest growing segments is delivery vans, with ~2M more delivery vehicles needed globally by 2030 [link](https://gyazo.com/309703e692c4a4fa96cd91096b593ac4). It’s important to keep in mind existing fleet conversion to EV as well. Using the common platform provides a pivot-ability to focus on high margin products and is a large and profitable opportunity – highly lucrative and accretive to overall margin [link](https://gyazo.com/51a7448bc7b0c236d6c4b528eb662dda). 

Canoo is also looking at car data and not just strictly being a vehicle manufacturer – with an opportunity for harmonizing hardware and software + superior cleaning leading to actionable data instead of the status quo of outsourced hardware + poor cleaning leading to disjointed data. Each connected vehicle offers 1 – 2 TB of raw data per day, with car data monetization globally valued at $250 Billion - $400 Billion [link](https://gyazo.com/d1e6a55ce2f1bb3777020592281afe8f).

To sum it up – Canoo is well-positioned for success with a differentiated business model [link](https://gyazo.com/6b0ce0f9af42b090b04e970aafe696fe), developing exceptional products that are aimed at the most profitable segments ($115B+ for 90% 2020 profit pool) in the US, addressing upfitting and accessories market in the US by monetizing full vehicle lifetime value with emphasis on 2nd, 3rd and 4th customers (valued at $24B+), and monetization of car data globally through customer-centric, software ecosystem generating exponential network effect ($250B+)

**Now why on earth would these long-established and assumingly well-reputed individuals with executive level careers at places including the United Nations, U.S. Department of State, Nio, Tesla, FCA Fiat Chrysler, Daimler AG/Mercedez-Benz, General Motors, Nissan, Toyota, Hyundai, Honda, Salesforce, NASA, McAfee, PepsiCo, Samsung, Harley-Davidson etc. move to an upstart EV manufacturer within the last couple of months if they didn’t believe in it’s potential for success? Some of these individuals have spent 5-10 years with their prior companies, it doesn’t make sense that they’d all be jumping over to Canoo for a 1 year engagement.**

Other than the talent, Canoo has made a number of moves in in recent months as it moves closer to bringing the first of the Lifestyle Vehicles to production, including:

Announcing plans to build its new factory outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma, creating more than 2,000 jobs and opening in 2023. The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant. Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar).

Partnering with VDL Nedcar as a contract manufacturing partner to manufacture the Lifestyle Vehicle for the US &amp; EU markets while it builds its US-based mega micro-factory. By parallel pathing contract and owned manufacturing Canoo will meet its commitment to start production and deliver vehicles in Q4, 2022. Canoo Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that VDL Nedcar ‘is the top trusted European manufacturer building high quality products for leading OEMs, and they significantly outcompeted the other contenders. VDL is also independently owned by the van der Leegte family of entrepreneurs - which aligns with our commitment to support businesses that form the backbone of communities. This strategic partnership will enable us to deliver vehicles to market while we build our Phase 2 factory in Oklahoma. It also strongly positions us for geographic expansion in Europe and builds a lasting relationship with VDL Groep of companies. Our investment will help us scale quickly and fulfill our mission to bring affordable, purpose-built EVs to Everyone. The Nedcar facility is slated to build up to 1000 units for both the US and European markets in 2022 with a target of 15,000 units in 2023 [link]( https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner)


De-risking the path to market, Canoo designed, built and tested beta for its lifestyle vehicle [link](https://gyazo.com/e9e9bee044f83da1536c1ab57809dece), with highlights including:

* &gt;$250M invested in Beta

* ~1.5M hours of engineering

* ~500k miles of testing

* 13 beta runners / 32 beta properties tested

* US NCAP 5-star overall rating targeted, with simulated, sled and vehicle level crash testing.

Undertaking the Gamma Phase with SOP on track for Q4 2022 [link]( https://gyazo.com/772813dd1ab4b30255dfdfa9674006ce), with key highlights including:

* &gt;12 months of testing

* ~120-150 vehicles will be built and validated

* ~70 crash tests

* 30 sled tests

* Full slate of vehicle tests; no shortcuts

* 80% of all components are sourced

* 63% of all engineering is released

* 54% of tooling is committed

Partnering with the frontdoor collective for 10,000 MPDVs, the frontdoor collective are a network of delivery service partners that provide dependable last-mile delivery experience, with founders and executives with experience from FedEx, Walmart, XPO, Amazon, Instacart and the U.S. military. With more than 100 franchisees with experience in delivering for companies like Amazon, XPO, Axlehire and Ontrac, the company, aims to expand that to 300 franchisees by the end of this year [link](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-frontdoor-collective-executives-explain-importance-of-franchised-dsp-network). 

Surpassing 9,500 non-binding pre-orders across lifestyle vehicle, pickup track and multi-purpose delivery vehicle [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/second-quarter-2021-results) 

Showcasing its vehicles at various events including the ACT Expo and Cars &amp; Coffee (both of which were attended by some of the amazing folks at the canoo subreddit who attended, took detailed notes/pictures and shared it with everyone), and receiving invites to others such as the LA Auto show [link](https://gyazo.com/ff9b83052183c0128970b65c4e05aa55).

**Part 5 – Financials and Valuation**

Before looking at Canoo/Competitors, here are some analyst PTs

* R.F. Lafferty - $19 [link]( https://www.investing.com/news/rf-lafferty-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-canoo-2568124)

* H.C. Wainright - $15 [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-goev-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-09/)

* Bank of America - $5 (can’t find the article at the moment but I’m sure I’ve seen it somewhere)

Average = $13, current SP = $6.7

As of Canoo’s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million [link](https://investors.canoo.com/financial-information/balance-sheet), which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing its first products to markets [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=9398). 

At a pre-revenue stage there’s not too much to say in this department, other than to note that value of a couple of orders:

* &gt;9,500 non-binding preorders – which if they are followed through with would be worth at least $313,500,00 (assuming 9,500 orders of the cheapest vehicle which is the base model MPDV).

* 10,000 MPDVs for the frontdoor collective which would be worth at least $330,000,000 (assuming cheapest MPDV).
As far as valuations go, let’s divide the pre-revenue EV manufacturers into tiers for an easier look – based on their market cap. I’m sure some are missing because I only took a few, let me know and I’ll add them in later. These market caps were taken within a few moments of each other on 9/21 from yahoo finance.

* Lucid Motors – $41.23B, 11,000 pre-orders, delivery delayed to fall 2021

* Nikola Corporation - $4.25B, lowered delivery guidance of 25/50 vehicles for 2021 

* Fisker Inc - $3.917B, &gt;17,000 pre-orders, value of $637,483,000 

* Faraday Future - $3.66B, 300 FF 91 Vehicles, value of $54,000,000 delivery in 2022 

* Canoo – $1.63B, 19,500 pre-orders (9,500 individual + 10,000 front door collective), value of $643,500,000, delivery fall 2022 for LV, 2023 for MPDV 

* Company 1 (market cap too low, has a DOJ investigation ongoing and issued a going concern for whether it would have cash to make it to production) - $1.2B

Just looking at a couple of examples here it would seem that Canoo is undervalued purely on a pre-orders/revenue perspective. Fisker and Faraday Future, which are both expected to deliver in 2022 as is the case with Canoo, have over double the market cap despite Canoo having similar preorder value (compared to Fisker) or much higher (compared to Faraday Future). Haven’t done a cash flow analysis of every company but even taking into consideration Fisker having $400M more in cash on hand [source](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/), there’s a significant discrepancy. Faraday Future meanwhile has less than half of Canoo’s cash on hand at $230M [link](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/).  

**Part 6 – Bear Case**

With anything pre-revenue, the biggest issue is always going to be do we have enough cash to get the product off the ground imo. I could write a really long paragraph but yea that’s pretty much it in a sentence. Since I’m on the bullish side for the company, I’ll lay out a few reasons why I think Canoo won’t be running out of $$$ before it comes to market – these have mostly been stated here and there throughout this document but I’ll summarize them below:

* As of Canoo’s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing the Lifestyle Vehicle to market. 

* Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility.

* EV funding is a significant portion of the upcoming budget, this is less grounded than the others but there is assumedly some hopium that Canoo would be able to receive some federal support if needed.

* The company could take on debt to assist in getting to production – H.C. Wainwright in their coverage indicated that they expect $500M to $525M in funding could be raised in debt to 2023. Tony has previously stated that they are looking for as non-dilutive an approach as possible, and given the current SP it wouldn’t make much sense to go the additional equity route.

**Part 7 – SI and Squeeze Potential**

I know y’all have just been waiting for this so I’ll get right down to it. Famously developed by the esteemed /u/pennyether, the SMELL system is going to help us take a look at some key numbers that’ll help understand GOEV’s squeezability.

* Short Interest – 31.8 million shares, 32% of free float 

* Market Cap – - $1.63 Billion, not big enough that it’s immovable, not small enough that shorts would be able to cover without investing a decent amount of capital.

* Extremely Memeable – I mean… GOEV, like Go… EV, idk I think it ticks off the memeability criteria.

* Low Liquidity – Average volume per yahoo finance is 2.7M shares, which is 2.7% of the free float so any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on Canoo for cheap, with institutional inflows of $177M and only $2.56M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOEV/institutional-ownership/)

* Low Risk (IV) – Yep, current IV is 77.1% for 9/24 and 10/1 options. Please do NOT consider this financial advice, like at all, but if you’re one of the folks who look to just buy options for the sake of contributing to a gamma squeeze, take a read of the post /u/ChemaKyle made yesterday, specifically the portion pertaining to buying far OTM options and how it’s a bad idea if you want the MMs to hedge. There’s not much of a need to hedge vs something that doesn’t have a ramp up and no OI at the ATM values. I’d agree with his/her post and the commentators that buying ATM options and the underlying shares would have a greater chance at causing a gamma squeeze, but this is something you should research and do your own DD on as well based on your risk tolerance and investment threshold.

**Part 8 – TL;DR**

The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021, with total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. 

President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030, to support this EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in the proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. Either way, this is huge for Canoo which is offering base models of the Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV at &lt;$35,000, with the base pickup model expected to be priced similarly. 

Canoo aims to disrupt the current automotive model by taking a piece of the 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit which is generated after the first owner and traditionally ignored by manufacturers. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same. Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup) and targeting one of the fastest growing segments of delivery vans, for which ~2M more delivery vehicles will be needed globally by 2030, with its MPDV.

To facilitate this disruption, Canoo has developed the world’s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Canoo’s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else’s lineup… take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle. The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo’s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next.

* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed

* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants (compared to ~25% on ICE)

* &gt;70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.

If we take a look at all the funding incentives that are being proposed for consumers in an example with the Lifestyle Vehicle, the maximum federal rebate would be $12,500 on a new vehicle, and if we add in state incentives e.g. Illinois with it’s $4,000 rebate – that turns into a $16,500 rebate. The LV is priced at $34,750 which means that post-rebates you’re going to be getting it at almost half the price which is pretty ridiculous in comparison to ICE vehicles, add in the tighter emissions standards for ICE vehicles and Canoo starts looking pretty good.

If you made it this far, I’d like to thank you for reading this – I’d like to give a big shoutout to the community over on the canoo subreddit (not sure if I can link other subs so won’t). They’re extremely resourceful and dedicated individuals who provide a wealth of knowledge on the ongoings of the company – from driving to HQ and coincidentally finding an unrevealed product and sharing it with everyone, to attending EXPOs and other showcase events and dedicating their time to sharing vehicle images and detailed write-ups on conversations with Canoo leadership and potential customers. Y’all the real MVPs.

Also, mods, I mention cr\*pto in this post, but not in the context of shilling some POS cr\*ptocurrency, but rather in the context of an equity ($GREE) that mines cr\*pto. 

Okay retards, time for your daily lesson in buying the dip.

Greenidge Generation ($GREE) currently trades at around $30. Based on the way its recent merger was structured, this equates to roughly $3.45 pre-merger pricing. Pre-merger pricing was recently as high as $60. So, this is approximately a 94% decline. Just since the merger, $GREE has dropped 70%. Which brings me to my first point…

1. This dip is unjustified.

IMO, a 94% decline is absurd and represents a great buying opportunity. We’ve seen massive post-pump dips in the likes of $GME, $AMC, etc., and buying these dips would make you a wealthy autist indeed. (Not comparing $GREE to $GME, $AMC, etc., but providing a couple memorable examples of secondary pumps.)

Why the big dip, you ask? IMO, this is mostly due to a combination of scared bulls selling at a loss and institutional shorts terrorizing the stock (and today had macro factors at play obviously). Which brings me to my second point…

2. $GREE has overwhelming short interest (#1 most-shorted stock now).

If you've been following the stock, this shouldn’t come as a surprise. It appears that there are some shorts with very deep pockets trying to hold this stock down. [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/) ranks $GREE as the #1 most-shorted U.S. stock, with short interest at 68.36%. Frankly, if I were a betting man (I’m not, I hate money), I would bet the percentage is even higher now - $GREE seems to have attracted a lot of new shorts in the past few days.

3. $GREE is a cr\*pto play. Cr\*pto = 📈📈📈

Lots of investors (retail and institutional) want exposure to cr\*pto, but don’t necessarily want to partake in the Wild West*™* of cr\*pto trading.

If investors want exposure to cr\*pto, but instead want to partake in the Temperate and Hospitable East™ of U.S. equity options trading*,* B\*tcoin mining stocks like $GREE are a great alternative. In general, this space has performed quite well. In the past year, $MARA has gone up 1,693.12%. $RIOT has surged 839.59%. (In the same timeframe, $B\*C increased only 300%). 

$GREE appears to be an especially interesting play for cr\*pto mining. $GREE is significantly expanding its mining capabilities: [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/greenidge-generation-orders-10000-b\*tcoin-miners-right-after-nasdaq-listing-2021-09-15](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/greenidge-generation-orders-10000-bitcoin-miners-right-after-nasdaq-listing-2021-09-15) Furthermore, from the article: ""The addition of 10,000 new miners is an important step in our commitment to expand our fully carbon-neutral capacity.” Emphasis on “carbon-neutral”: as we’ve seen, the environmental implications of B\*tcoin mining have been catalysts for big moves in the cr\*pto markets, so this makes $GREE an attractive play.

For additional evidence, see here: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/15/why-sphere-3d-stock-soared-26-today/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/15/why-sphere-3d-stock-soared-26-today/). When Sphere 3D announced news about its merger partner receiving equipment for carbon-neutral cr\*pto mining, it popped 26%; yet $GREE saw the same news, on the same day (September 15), and dropped like a rock.

As always, do your own DD. I see lots of bulls on message boards that are pretty pessimistic, likely due to large paper losses that seem to grow each day (may also just be bashers pretending to be bulls). Personally, wouldn’t be surprised to see $GREE rebound, likely above its merger price of $102, which would still represent an 81% discount from the peak. The shorts seem quite overextended.

I have been looking at large options trades that occurred between the 10th of January and the 10th of February as well as the net cumulative premiums and I thought I would share it for future reference.

The thing that is the most striking, is that there were a lot of them. Even though the movement was driven by retail investors, some large investors were on board and helped create the squeeze. The 2 largest options trades over that period were for \~$50.5 and \~$33 million dollars. These are huge. Both executed above the ask. You can see here the top trades for the period. The vast majority of them being calls.

&amp;#x200B;

If we look at the net cumulative premiums (among large orders), we can see that, even though both calls and puts spiked, call premiums outweighed puts premiums (approximately $250 million dollars extra on the call side).  Perhaps, with all these calls outstanding, it would have been a great opportunity to keep squeezing the stock... The net premiums were slightly positive in March on the second run-up and only slightly positive today.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though the recent large options trades have been mostly on the bullish side. The number and size don't match the level of January.

&amp;#x200B;

The distribution of call premiums remained however quite large, with several bets being made with strikes as high as $950.

A [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pq0aiy/gme_is_about_to_fuk_u_with_its_negative_beta/) on the front page has claimed that GME has a negative beta, which it quite skillfully proves by rotating a screenshot of GME relative to SPY (does this guy work for Goldman?) after seeing different sources show GME with a negative beta post squeeze. He then takes this full proof metric and uses it alongside an equally undeniable technical based bearish SPY prediction to suggest you should buy GME. This man somehow knows for certain that SPY will go down, and instead of leveraging to the tits on puts like a true degen, betting against the livelihood of millions of working class people, he peddles you his hefty bags.


**But what if GME’s beta wasn’t actually negative 😲:**

Beta is a metric, which aims to correlate the price action of a stock relative to the overall market through comparing returns with SPY. Beta can be calculated in a variety of ways over a variety of different data sizes (var/covar, relative fitted slopes, etc. over 1-5Y at a daily, monthly, tri-monthly, or yearly rate).

Now, beta for GME since the squeeze has been negative for a variety of sources. One example is [Zacks](https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/GME/fundamental/beta), which has it dropping to -2.21 post squeeze. The thing is, that number is based on a very specific distribution of data points and weightings (most probs equal) that change from one calculation and broker/site to another. What if I told you we could calculate beta ourselves?


**Please be careful ⚠️Retard At Work⚠️:**

I have chosen the most commonly used and relevant method to calculate beta, which takes into consideration both relative volatility and direction of movement since others may only take into consideration one:

The standard deviation of the asset’s (GME) returns (daily and monthly percentage change) over the designated period (multiple periods to show how they differ) divided by the same thing for the benchmark asset (SPY) multiplied by the correlation (R, pearson’s) between the returns.

The idea is that the standard deviation division represents the relative volatility and correlation shows direction. I have also done the analysis over different periods and bin frequencies to show how beta changes. Now, you can get historical data from any site (marketwatch, yahoo, zacks, etc.) and you can run the analysis, which you can check [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fnR3ncF4ifq7vTE9KOvanPLf76UydxF7?usp=sharing) and (please feel free to look it over as I did this after 16 hours of work today (don’t get into consulting kids) and may have made some errors).

Results:


Daily:
5Y (starting from today): R= 0.09  ,  β= 1.18
3Y : R=0.09  ,  β= 1.21
1Y : R=0.03  ,  β= 1.02
During first squeeze : R= -0.3  ,  β= -38 (wew)
Post-squeeze : R= 0.3  ,  β= 3.87 (oh boy)

Monthly:
5Y (starting from September 2021): R= 0.02  ,  β= 1.01
3Y : R=0.02  ,  β= 0.95
1Y : R=0.02  ,  β= 2.79
During first squeeze : R= -1  ,  β= -193 (lmao)
Post-squeeze : R= 0.68  ,  β= 17.8 (kek)

**Hmmmm but what does it all mean…🤔:**

As you can see from the data, monthly vs. daily does affect the data (which is part of the point, you can’t just pick a random number you saw on the internet and use it but claim every single other one is cooked by the illuminati) but the same general patterns appear. Note: There’s a possibility where the way you pick your bins completely hides both squeezes (taking returns before and after with the squeeze is in the middle), so there are issues with how time periods are set.

The 5Y and 3Y data shows that GME (LIKE ALL FUCKING STOCKS except like gold and stuff) are completely correlated with the market in the long-term. For the 1Y, the monthly data begins to show the early signs of reversal which would eventually lead to the squeeze and is still positive, since SPY always goes up since JPow, peace be upon him, says so. During the squeeze, all shit goes to hell and SPY tanks (we’ll go over why soon) and we get these monstrous KONG LEVEL negative betas. However, post squeeze for both data sets shows that we actually are insanely POSITIVE. THIS should be the apes’ thesis. That the stock is actually in an insane upwards trend and THAT’s why you should go long, but for some reason apes not only want themselves to be rich, but for everyone else to be poor.

Now, why is beta negative for other sources? Because each site calculates it in its own way. Their distribution of bins, their starting points, and potentially their weightings change everything. Some calculations may be weighted more around this year or by extent of price action. FFS the monthly beta for the squeeze is -138 (NEGATIVE ONE THIRTY EIGHT). You don’t think the effect of that will distort numbers for a while?


Why was beta negative during the squeeze (and similarly but to a much less extent on the other runs)? The first run scared the market because of the back ups in the clearing houses. The volatility caused by these stocks (highest retail volume of all time btw on Jan 26-27) caused issues with T+2 clearing, since brokers were clearing trades that the DTCC said they didn’t have the funds on hand to cover the risk for. Which shows why we need same-day clearing, but that’s a whole other thing. Since SPY had already hulk-dicked its way out of COVID and felt overextended at the time (lmao if only they knew how strong the printer brrrs), people started to pull their money out because the system was potentially going to be DYSFUNCTIONAL. No clearing = NO TRADING AT ALL. Other squeezes since (as evidenced by the post squeeze betas) have not shown the same dips since there was no systemic risk. 

On the other side, the idea that the market crashing will cause GME to moon is fundamentally utterly retarded (not in the good way). If the thesis is built around naked shorting (which isn’t on any books and requires no return/cover since there is no borrowee), why the FUCK would there be a buyback, if no one can see them on any balance sheets. Now, say you wanna flip flop again randomly and mix theses like you’re a bunch of bored thirteen year olds experimenting with bodily fluids. If the shorts are borrowed and hence on someone’s balance sheet and the market begins to crash, NO ONE WILL GIVE A SHIT ABOUT MEMES. There is potential that memes get piled into by funds that got out early or are liquid, as institutions know apes and tards alike would literally go balls deep long if they see their ticker moving up, even if SPY is on its way to the Earth’s core. However, there’s no way to know for sure that will happen, but I can assure you that maintaining their actual GIGANTIC giga-cap longs that they hold on insane margin/leverage and ensuring those stay afloat will definitely make them think twice about holding GME at $200 to sell IV off.

In sum, just because someone says something and uses memes to prove their point, although quite amusing, doesn’t mean they’re right or have actually looked at any data or EVEN UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN THESIS. Do your own DD, or just chase a de-space redemption gamma squeeze play you barely read in the daily, idk I’m not your dad (I hope).

TL;DR: Long term beta is 1 (cuz all stonks, including SPY go up). Squeeze beta is negative because of systemic risk caused by issues/rumors about back-house clearing and risk based collateral requirements increasing as well as an insane squeeze. Post-squeeze beta is actually POSITIVE AS FUCK, and could potentially be the real reason you would want to go long, but will surely fuck you if the printer runs out of ink (it wont, $SPY 690 coming to a theater near you soon).",True,False,False,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52,10854275,public,confidence,self,In light of today: Why $GME (and other meme stocks) actually don’t actually have a negative beta.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ps0o1r/in_light_of_today_why_gme_and_other_meme_stocks/,some_ads,7,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'rXWe1fahlvTGLTZ4W051gVoy14Fze-256cUC6xzbeQw', 'resolutions': [], 'source': {'height': 72, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/QI5iGl-ZvtFDdwgem41jZqv-hdVKidnan3sLgmkVNE0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=c95cf917a5dab610f4b51ee4982f2c4235def321', 'width': 72}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, before I get the hell beat out of me: please know I own other GME shares in another brokerage. These shares are old, I’ve just been too busy &amp; lazy to transfer them. However, I finally decided to transfer them about 2 weeks ago. At least I tried to. RH only allows email contact, so it took them 4 days to even respond to my email. They tell me I can do a partial, or full transfer to another brokerage. I tell them Computershare is not a brokerage. They then tell me that RH currently does NOT support DRS transfers. WTF? This can’t be right, I’m thinking. After speaking with a very nice guy at Computershare, he gives me the phone # to the DTCC and says have RH call them to ask how to do it if they don’t know how, which he said they definitely should know how. 
Great, I send off another email. RH again replies telling me they currently do not support DRS transfers. 
So, I called the DTCC this morning. Got a awesome guy named Chris on the line. Explain to him my problem/issue. He tells me I’m absolutely 100% correct in everything I said to him. He gave me not 1, but, 2, direct PHONE NUMBERS for RH to actually speak to someone. The 1st number for Alexandria Petrone-Harps is not working, but the 2nd # worked. I’ve left Ms. Brittney Marshall a VM. We will see how long it takes for her to call back, if ever. 
But Chris, at the DTCC also gave me his direct # and said if they still tell you they can’t/won’t do it, you call me back, let me know which one said it, and I will personally call them and set it straight. Wow, thanks Chris, appreciate the back up. Chris also let me know that as a DTCC employee, his employer made him close out all his positions with RH. Told him they don’t like they way they do business and don’t want their employees trading with them. Interesting. 🧐
Anyway, just thought I’d share that tid bit of info. Please don’t beat me up over RH, or this post. I’m old, and new at this SM stuff.

Would AMC Entertainment Holdings partnering with GameStop really result in a worthwhile collaboration that could make either company a buy? Or is it just a bit of fan service that won't go anywhere?

On the surface, the idea of two failing businesses joining forces and somehow coming out stronger seems far-fetched. Both companies are in decline, and had it not been for the meme stock trading frenzy that gripped their shares, both would likely be a lot closer to bankruptcy at this moment.

Still, scratch a little deeper and an argument can be made that both companies might benefit from synergies derived from working together.

Ready, set, wait 
Investors were teased with this idea last month when CEO Adam Aron of AMC told analysts that partnering with GameStop was one of the most-asked questions he receives from shareholders. He wanted them to know he was ""on the case,"" even though he had yet to actually reach out to GameStop CEO Matt Furlong or chairman Ryan Cohen.

But Aron has apparently taken action since. He told the Fox Business Network's Liz Claman during a recent interview that AMC contacted the video game retailer about a partnership, talks are ongoing, but it was too early to go into specifics on what a collaboration would look like.

BREAKING: $AMC @CEOAdam Aron to @ClamanCountdown: We have made contact with $GME @GameStop on a partnership, we're not ready to say what it is."" says AMC now playing offense to get folks back to the theatres w/epic $25m ad spend

September 8, 2021
But what would a partnership look like?

Taking esports to the big screen
The most natural fit would seem to be streaming gaming tournaments in theaters. It's something AMC has experience in through Fathom Events, a company it owns a one-third stake in. Fathom streams alternative entertainment onto big screens, such as Metropolitan Opera performances, sporting events, and comedy shows. Aron sees it extending to other areas, including video gaming events.

He said during AMC's earnings conference call: ""But I think there's a real opportunity here and we're going to chase it, the same with sports, the same with gaming. There's really a possibility here to find a new source of revenue that AMC has not tapped before.""

With GameStop also changing direction to become an increasingly digitally native brand, and one that is immersing itself in the rapidly growing esports space, the idea of a theater providing a venue for viewing these events has merit. It's the execution of the concept that could be difficult.

Watching video games being played on the big screen might not be as conducive to enjoyment as watching it in more-intimate settings, such as on a computer or on a big-screen TV, where they're more commonly enjoyed when it's not a live and in-person event.

Moreover, we still haven't escaped the restrictions the pandemic has imposed on our daily activities, including going to the theater and competitive game play. Movie theaters might not be the kind of venue to provide sufficient capacity to make it attractive to players, viewers, or AMC and GameStop themselves.

GameStop is going slow
GameStop is also much more guarded about its plans than AMC, which has fully embraced its meme stock status and openly courts the WallStreetBets crowd. Even during its earnings conference call, GameStop didn't take any questions.

This effort is being directed by AMC, and that could be telling, because it is in a far more precarious financial position than GameStop, meaning it might be more willing to throw outlandish ideas at the wall to see if they stick. 

The video game retailer has paid down virtually all of its debt, has a substantial cash horde, and might not be as willing to go off on larks as Aron is. AMC, on the other hand, while it has $2 billion in liquidity available, is also carrying $5.6 billion in debt.

As my Motley Fool colleague Sean Williams recently pointed out, AMC also has billions of dollars in lease payments and other obligations coming due that could be difficult to pay.

Game over?
I won't completely dismiss an AMC-GameStop partnership as having some value. It might even be successful if it comes to fruition.  

The problem is that it's not likely to happen soon, so it won't help either company out of its current predicament.

Read and you might learn something.** 

**Some intro:** I model how market making options moves underlying stocks. This has led to some cool predictions like a certain GameStore on a certain week in January doing some unusual things. Seriously go check my stuff out. Options move the underlying in a very quantifiable manner. Additionally examining the OI gives insights into market sentiment and price expectations. 

**Some requisite information and assumptions before getting started.**

Options are extremely volatile. That's why we're all here but Market Makers follow rules about hedging risks and for good reason. Near all options liquidity is provided by these firms which write the contracts and make money scalping the Bid/Ask (literally making the market). MM's usually have both ends of a trade, i.e short both calls and puts, which balances out but the net difference results in a directional position. This has to be hedged for multiple reasons not limited to 1. going bankrupt and 2.  betting against clients (this is serious.) They make their money from scalping the B/A and IV crush. Options are priced that if Δ neutral, the MM makes money when IV decreases and loses if it increases. 

That brings us to Delta (Δ). **Δ is the rate of change with respect to spot price (+/- $1)**. Now that doesn't mean anything but think about Δ as the % chance an option expires itm (implied moneyness). This is also the directional risk for a MM who wrote the contract. Gamma Γ is the rate of change of Δ for +/- $1 on the underlying. Γ is also hedged on MM books. This is done by trading shares and contracts of the underlying which influences price discovery resistance levels. 

To model this we make a few assumptions:

* All contracts are being hedged directionally neutral (This isn't true but is an acceptable assumption to yield a working model)
* The directional risk of a call and put on the same strike counteract
* Enough of the boring stuff

This will be less in depth and more broad in scope than my previous work. More of an overview for the week. A few of these tickers (the SPACS) were requests and not my own positions. Also ignore the ""Hybrid Factor %"". I'm trying something new to  measure signal. Higher should be better but idk if if works yet.

* Significant Strikes Γ $450/ Γ $445/ -Δ $440/ -Γ $430
* $430p 15 OCT 21 as an insurance policy for Evergrande Contagion and tapering effects
* $450c NOV if market stabilizes end of week
* Overwhelming negative delta. Little positive delta +$450
* I’ve been modeling SPY this way for sometime and it’s bizarre to get this result
* Reflects current market fears. Looks ugly for next two weeks
* Hedging $440-442 moves 19% of Friday volume (2x historical AV)

* \+Δ $6/+Γ $10 as significant levels
* 15 OCT 21 $9c is a decent bet given the gamma ramp to $10
* Everything else looks normal besides daily volume/hedging ratio
* Not sure about the fundamentals but looks like a promising play

&amp;#x200B;

* Very straightforward read
* \+Δ $65/ +Γ $70/ -Δ $60
* Safe play long both 15 OCT 21 $65c $70c 
* $69c for the memes?
* Mean reversion opportunity
* Chart looks good if you’re into that kind of thing. I’m not
* I like this one

* Strange options OI on $20 but there’s not a viable play without a positive catalyst and the underlying business sucks
* Could be institutional hedging positions and poor expectations for PIPE unlock by shareholders in (late?) October
* Unfamiliar with 8K and de-SPAC terms
* \-Δ $10/ +Γ $15/ +Γ $20

* \-Γ $270/ -Δ $280/ +Δ $310/ +Δ $340
* Still like the long play but would consider trimming exposure or delevering
* Has showed resistance to broader market moves in the past few weeks
* If (big if) the Evergrande contagion affects US capital market liquidity then UPST will suffer but so far seems highly insulated
* $350c JAN 23 leap
* 320c NOV is a decent mid term play but UPST is a Vega orgy

**VLTA ($13.04 Spot)**

* This ticker was requested
* Nothing abnormal to signify a trading opportunity
* Heavy OI on $20 strike but would need a catalyst to get there

**IRNT ($30.26 Spot)**

* Options chain still looks similar to Thursday
* My guess is pinned at $30 for a duration
* More likely to break to downside
* I’d recommend a play to capture volatility. The long gamma squeeze opportunity looks played out as of Friday
* To note, Friday price settled 0.26 off the $30 boundary I outlined
* Still not trading this

**FUSE ($10.02 Spot)**

* Also requested
* Hard to say anything without more strikes and data
* Overall +Δ 10-15 strikes
* If you’re going long, then extend out to $15c/$17.5c to coincide with Γ ramp

**TSLA ($759.49 Spot)**

* Nailed the close on Friday ($-0.11 off) 
* Elevated Friday volume on 24 SEP 21 $760c when someone was closing out position
* Remaining options activity is low after OPEX
* I don’t see a weekly play but TSLA puts will print if SPY goes tits up. Look for 730P 15 OCT 21 and don’t hold to expiry
* I’m old school around here so yolo TSLA calls is always the play. $780c but go way out and wait for SPY to settle
* Elon I still love you

* Fuck
* Stable Δ at $200, +Γ $210, +Γ $250
* Negligible -Δ (GME ber r kill)
* With a positive catalyst, $250 strike will benefit from gamma ramp
* Overall options volume is way down
* Nothing very interesting
* If you have way OTM options (+290c) expiring soon it might be time to bail if there’s any premium left
* $250c a few months out (NOV or DEC) is a solid play if you must

The $DUDE here with another of my periodic ""Dude Diligence"" reports...

For those that haven't yet seen Part 1 which was my initial comprehensive look at Clover Health Investments AKA $CLOV here's the link below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pn6gev/clov\_dd\_the\_dude\_diligence\_report\_912\_edition/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pn6gev/clov_dd_the_dude_diligence_report_912_edition/)

I've been creating &amp; publishing these periodic due diligence reports more than anything to clear up a lot of the rampant misinformation that's continually perpetuated here on WSB with regards to CLOV.  I'll also be updating it, clarifying sections if needed and fixing typos to keep it fresh and will continue to do this so it can become the one-stop thread here on WSB that any of you CLOV Apes can reference and direct people to if needed.  

I know a lot of the misinfo (unfortunately) ...is passed along (potentially) on purpose because ""...clov is a distraction, blah, blah"" say the $AMC apes, but then wait, isn't ""...amc is the distraction"" according the $GME apes and so on, and so on...

People, guess what... all apes are ultimately on the same team and none of these factions are distractions from each other, instead they show a growing collective strength retail traders are building to combat greasy HF's and anyone else aligned with them to manipulate and steal from retail traders.  We're ALL fed up with the lack of transparency in our manipulated system- doesn't matter if you team GME, AMC or CLOV... we can't continue with the infighting, when in the end, we're all fighting for the same thing.  There's plenty to go around when the timing is right for each...

Anyway, this DD report won't be as comprehensive as last weeks- it'll be quite a bit more brief and I'll be focusing on some of the catalyst I believe will be influencing CLOV price action over the next 1-2 months and beyond.

As always, this is made up of my opinions, I'm not a financial advisor nor is this intended as financial advice.  Invest at your own risk and do your own due diligence.  I like this stock long-term and do currently have a sizable position.  

Also, I'm more active on Twitter ( [https://twitter.com/nikiped1a](https://twitter.com/nikiped1a) ) than I am here on reddit, so if you like this or any of my other write ups, I'd love to hear your feedback both positive or negative (I'm always doing my best to improve and learn from all of you and know I can get things wrong at times.)

**CATALYSTS INFLUENCING CLOV PRICE ACTION LEADING UP TO Q3 EARNINGS**

CLOV Q3 earnings are upcoming with the quarter ending on Oct 31, 2021.  The Earnings Release will be on or around Nov 11th (hasn't been officially announced yet).

For those of you not familiar with Clover Health Investments- you probably immediately think ""healthcare company"" right?  Well, wrong... kindof.  CLOV is a next-gen technology (software/A.I.) driven company playing in the crusty, dinosaur healthcare industry.  If you think of it any other way, you're entirely missing what their mission is.  It's to change and disrupt a greedy, generally content-to-stay-the-same insurance space (again, if you want more depth, go read my previous write up at the link above)

Before I get into the most recent items, I want to reiterate what I detailed in my last DD that will really start to come into play in this upcoming ER.  CLOV announced their plan to double their market size at the end of Q2.  So their **140% YoY revenue growth in Q2** did not include any of this potential new territory.

...let that sink in.

CLOV then announced a little over a month later (early Aug '21) their partnership allowing them to now do business in the state of Florida beginning in 2022 stating this:

""...*Through the arrangement, ValueH will support Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and Management Services Organizations (MSOs) participating in Clover’s Direct Contracting Entity beginning in 2022.*

*Clover’s DCE will enable providers to manage the care of their Original Medicare patients with the Clover Assistant. The Clover Assistant is a clinical software tool used by doctors at the point of care to provide them with data-driven, personalized recommendations to improve how they care for their patients. Participating providers can benefit from:*

* ***Unified, Actionable Data****: access lab results, prescription lists, and previous diagnoses, including those from other clinicians*
* ***Personalized Care Plans****: receive and share new information at each patient visit and have access to clinical decision support*
* ***Simple, Fast Reimbursement****: receive the Clover Assistant reimbursement within seven days for each patient seen with the Clover Assistant*  


*“We are excited to partner with ValueH to help support our efforts to increase the quality of care delivered to patients while simultaneously lowering medical costs...”*

In summary, nearly doubling their market potential (not including their new partnership in Florida) will be massive heading into the Medicare Open Enrollment period beginning on Oct 15, 2021 and continuing through Dec 7, 2021.  This will give CLOV 17 days of OE before Q3 ends and provide us with a glimpse into their Medicare Advantage enrollment growth as a teaser in their ER.  

Speaking of Open Enrollment, one other big announcement that will be provided leading up to Open Enrollment is Clover Health's updated 2022 Medicare Star Rating.

Every year, Medicare evaluates plans based on a 5-star rating system. Medicare Star Ratings help you know how good a job a plan is doing. You can use these Star Ratings to compare plan's performance to other plans. 

As of last year's rating, Clover Health has a 3.0 star Overall rating (3.5 stars for Health Plans and 3.0 star for Drug Plan Services

The biggest bit of news relevant to investors that comes from these updated rating will be how much of a ""bonus"" CLOV is paid per life under management.   This chart below shows the variance of Average Bonus paid out per enrollee- some as low as $169 and some as high $660 per enrollee.  

I wasn't able to find specific info on what Clover's payout was this past year, but they definitely have a fair amount of opportunity to increase their star rating and thus increasing bonuses paid out.  Even a marginal 5 -10% bump would be significant to CLOV's operating margins that have raised questions by some potential investors in the rapidly expanding growth company.

There was also some news that came out last week about UnitedHealthcare that could be a potential catalyst in a few of the states they operate in.  UHG is facing sanctions from enrolling new members in a number of midwestern states, Arkansas, New Mexico. 

The three UnitedHealthcare plans penalized by the federal government provide coverage for about 86,000 people, which is just a fraction of the company's total Medicare Advantage enrollment of nearly 7.5 million people.  To put that into perspective, Clover currently has around 65K Medicare Advantage enrollees, so even though it's a ""fraction"" of the enrollees to a massive company like UHG, this would be a boon to have less competition in these regions and pick up any of these enrollees in the states CLOV currently operates in, which at this point only seems to be potentially Kansas, but that is based on info that could be out of date.

&amp;#x200B;

**HAS THE BOTTOM ARRIVED AND IS A MOMENTUM SHIFT COMING IN HOT?**

For some others that have been trading and monitoring CLOV for several months and now have a general understand it's daily and weekly patterns, there seems to be a potential shift in sentiment since the middle of August- not surprisingly given their Q2 earnings surprise that I feel shocked a lot of CLOV naysayers and opened a lot of others eyes to the exponential growth opportunity it is beginning to unveil.

One thing I think, that has been frustrating for some investors is how CLOV's management team hasn't really combatted any of the misinformed attacks on them directly, but instead, through actions and beating expectations.  Personally, I kind of like that approach as we all know talk is cheap, and actions speak much, MUCH louder than words.  It also shows a composed confidence they appear to have in their product and growth opportunity.

I feel these next 5 weeks we are going to see a lot of investors get into CLOV before their next earnings.

I can't confirm this for certain, but this past week a number of people in the CLOV community have seen massive after-hours dark pool prints that could potentially be institutional long buys.  We're talking 1.2M shares purchased AH this past Wed, multiple 1M+ buys on Thurs and numerous 500K-1M+ buys on Fri totaling over 5M shares again, within minutes of market close.

I'm waiting to see what the data looks like tomorrow morning (on Mon, Sept 20th) but from what I can tell, it may be institutional short positions being covered and them shifting to long positions.  Again, this is unconfirmed at this point, but from the information I am seeing- that's what it looks like.

I think it goes without saying that this would be a very bullish signal having between $40-$60M in large single block (institutional) purchases.  I'm going to keep my eye on this and I'd love to hear any of your thoughts on the matter.

Lastly, I want to give you all an idea of how I think about CLOV price action.  THIS IS NOT A PRICE TARGET, but instead ranges and timelines of how I think about CLOV.

I'm going to list these out because I've seen a number of probably new or less experienced investors to CLOV post some nervous commentary asking if they should sell (at a loss) or not.  My advice is this;  look at the data, look at the potential long term- in my view, everything is screaming #BullishAF.  Do your own DD and know what you're working with.

Sometimes you just have to check out when it's in the midst of declining 7 straight trading sessions so you're not watching every single move downward, wanting to punch your monitor.  Keep the long-term perspective in mind stick with your gut intuition.

With that said, here are some ranges I think we \*could\* see over the next 9-12 months and how I look at it:

**Sept 20th - approx. Nov 15 (whenever Q3 earnings are released):  $7.50- $12 range**

CLOV could very well dip back down to $7.50, though at this point, I feel it would be unlikely.  Barring any macro economic event, I see us prob staying above $8 moving forward as this is a great accumulation zone.  I think we could see some quick spikes back up to$10 or $11+ but I don't see us breaking $12 until we get Q3 data and have a clearer picture of the direction of the company in terms of FCF, revenue, open enrollment momentum, etc.  If all this comes in strong, expect a significant surge in sustainable price, not just a pump and dump.

**Nov 15 - approx. Feb 15 (when Q4 earnings are released): $12- $17 range**

I think this is conservative, but I like setting conservative expectations and then being surprised on the upside.  

I really think this could be a huge quarter because Open Enrollment will have come and gone, CLOV will probably jump from the 65Kish MA lives under mgmt to 75-80K+ and continue their 20%+ annual growth rate, however, what gets interesting is their Direct Contracting Entity numbers currently at \~60K.  

The Q4 ER will not only include all the MA enrollees, but it will include a month of the DCE number that will be counted between  Jan 1-31 2022.  I wouldn't be surprised if we see this jump 10's of thousands, especially with the Florida partnership becoming active as well.  CLOV could have 100-150K+ DCE enrollees, putting upwards of a quarter million lives total (DCE+MA) under mgmt.  

Of note, and not that it matters because I think all these ratings firms are corrupt and in on the market manipulation, but CLOV initially had $18-$20 PT's from a number of these large firms when CLOV had mentioned the potential of 200K lives under mgmt.  If we're 25% more than that, where does the PT go?

Also of note, even those I hate these greasy analysts, we very well could see some PT upgrades even before Q3 ER (after the firm buys in a $8 today, and then manipulates the price in their favor by upgrading it shortly afterward, just like we've saw them do (BoA and Cowen) with their short positions on the way down \*facepalm\* ...honestly, it's such a joke.  I don't know why anyone other than Boomers (that knew a more trustworthy American system in better days of yore compared to our dumpster fire that's being run into the ground today) that trust these anal-yst tools... but I digress.

What I'm getting at is that when an upgrade or new PT comes, that could accelerate these ranges I'm listing substantially.

**Feb 15- approx. May 15 (whenever Q1 earnings are released): $17- $45+ ( range**

If at this point, we see 3 solid earnings reports or even 2 out of 3 for Q2, Q3 and Q4, it will be hard to stop this bulldozer moving forward and I think we start to see it's true value being represented in it's stock price.

And last but not least- I'm basing these ranges off of fundamentals, not a squeeze... Do remember, there IS a potential of a juicy squeeze in there at some point- ...but in my mind, that's just the icing.
